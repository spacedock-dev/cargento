## Name

`server.py` starts, inspects and stops the Cargento coding-agent dashboard.

## Synopsis

```text
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py [OPTIONS]
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --diagnose [--json] [OPTIONS]
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --status [--port PORT]
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --stop [--port PORT]
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --forget [--port PORT]
```

Paths above are relative to the repository root. For a plugin installation, use the
`server.py` beside the installed `SKILL.md`; [find that copy](HOW_TO_USE.md#find-the-copy-your-commands-will-run)
and use the same launcher and port for start, status and stop. On Windows, use your Python 3.11+
command, such as `py -3`, in place of `python3`.

## Description

Cargento is a Python 3.11+ standard-library server that reads local coding-agent stores and displays
sessions across harnesses. With no operation flag it runs in the foreground until stopped. Open
`http://127.0.0.1:4553/` in a browser, or use the port you selected. `/api/data` serves the session
snapshot as JSON. The launcher does not open a browser for you.

The default bind is IPv4 loopback. Harness stores are read-only; Cargento keeps its own observations,
annotations and settings separately. Optional vendor quota requests, model analyses and webhook
nudges have different controls. See [Security](SECURITY.md#scope) for their disclosures and limits.

This file is the command reference. [How to use Cargento](HOW_TO_USE.md) owns harness configuration
and setup procedures. The [installed skill](cargento/skills/cargento/SKILL.md) remains self-contained
for agents that do not have the repository.

## Options

[Instance control](#starting-and-inspecting-an-instance) | [Models and quota](#model-use-and-quota) |
[History](#history-and-annotations) | [Workflow and events](#workflow-and-event-controls) |
[Notifications](#notifications-away-from-the-desk) | [Experimental interaction](#experimental-session-interaction)

Arguments written in capitals are values you supply. Boolean switches affect this invocation;
leaving an off switch out on a later start enables that feature again without deleting its store.
Pass one operation flag at a time. If combined, the current implementation chooses `--diagnose`,
then `--forget`, then `--stop`, then `--status`; it does not execute a sequence of operations.
`--daemon` with any of those four operations is a usage error.

### Starting and inspecting an instance

| Option | Behavior and default |
|---|---|
| `-h`, `--help` | Print the launcher's current option list and exit. |
| `--port PORT` | TCP port, an integer from 1 through 65535. Default: `4553`. Also selects the instance addressed by status, stop and forget. |
| `--host ADDRESS` | Accepts only `127.0.0.1` (default) or `0.0.0.0`. The latter exposes the dashboard on every IPv4 interface without authentication. Other addresses and IPv6 are rejected. Read [remote-access risks](SECURITY.md#known-and-accepted) before changing it; prefer an SSH tunnel. |
| `--daemon` | Detach and keep serving after the starting shell exits. Reports the URL, process ID and log path. Without it, serving stays in the foreground. On Windows the launcher starts a detached child; see [platform notes](#platform-notes). |
| `--status` | Report whether Cargento answers on the selected port, then exit. Distinguishes a running dashboard, no dashboard, stale state and a port held by another process. |
| `--stop` | Ask Cargento on the selected port to shut down and wait for the port to be free. A foreign process is left alone. If nothing is running, remove stale instance state if present. |
| `--diagnose` | Report the local store paths searched, whether they are readable and what was found; exit without serving, writing history or making model calls. Use it first when a harness is missing. |
| `--json` | Format `--diagnose` as JSON. Does not change status output or make the dashboard's normal output JSON. |
| `--window-hours HOURS` | Hide sessions with no activity within this many hours. Default: `24`. Accepts a floating-point number. This display window is separate from history retention. |

### Model use and quota

Reader-requested `Analyze drift` is available without `--observer-model` when the session is eligible
and the reader grants the disclosed permission. Optional goal summaries and unattended checks are
separate opt-ins. A model ID selects a reader, not permission to send content or proof of accuracy.

| Option | Behavior and default |
|---|---|
| `--observer-model` | Offer Codex model goal summaries in Console. Off by default; requires its own disclosure consent in the browser. Does not enable unattended drift checks. |
| `--claude-reading-model MODEL` | Explicit Claude model ID for Claude readings. Default: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Sonnet 5.5). The admission floor is Sonnet 5: explicit Sonnet or Opus generation 5 or later IDs are accepted, such as `claude-sonnet-5`. Floating aliases, Haiku and older generations are rejected. An admitted ID must still be available through your Claude Code installation. |
| `--unasked-readings` | Enable bounded Codex checks of annotated sessions without a fresh press; only departures are raised. Off by default. Spends model capacity and requires remembered Codex permission covering the current destination. Quiet hours can suppress checks. |
| `--no-observer-model`, `--no-harness-usage` | Equivalent names for refusing every model call for this run, including goal summaries, reader-requested analyses and unasked checks. Overrides both opt-ins above. |
| `--no-usage` | Refuse vendor quota network fetches and quota pushed into Cargento for this run, regardless of the stored dashboard setting. Quota recorded in harness-owned stores, such as Codex or Copilot, still appears. Does not disable model calls or reach nudges. |

### History and annotations

History records what Cargento observed. Annotations contain the goal and expected outcome you typed.
Switches below address those stores separately; a port selects an instance, not a separate history.
Dashboards using the same Cargento home share persistent stores.

| Option | Behavior and default |
|---|---|
| `--history-days DAYS` | Retain observations for this many days. Default: `14`. Must be finite and greater than zero; fractions are accepted. Narrowing the window evicts older records; widening it cannot recover them. |
| `--history-max-bytes BYTES` | History size and read cap. Default: `1048576` (1 MiB). Must be a positive integer. A history file larger than this cap is discarded unread rather than parsed. |
| `--no-history` | Do not read or write observation history for this run. Existing history is left on disk. Does not disable the separate annotations or session-end store. |
| `--no-annotations` | Do not read or write saved goals, expected outcome lines or readings for this run. The page offers no editable intent fields; `Analyze drift` remains visible but disabled with a reason. Existing annotations are left on disk. |
| `--no-dismiss` | Do not read or write the handled-session store. Previously handled sessions return to the board and its dismiss control is unavailable for this run. |
| `--forget` | A one-shot cleanup: delete observation history, recorded session ends and copied-correction digests; sweep annotation discard records; clear reading permission. Preserve the words you typed and unexpired model-spend timestamps. Refused while a dashboard answers on the selected port: stop it first. This is irreversible cleanup, not a feature-off switch. |

`--forget` checks only the named port. Stop every dashboard sharing that Cargento home before
cleanup; an instance on another port can otherwise retain or recreate observations. It does not
erase harness transcripts or every Cargento setting and store.

### Workflow and event controls

These features are enabled by default. An off switch suppresses the named feature for this run.

| Option | Behavior and default |
|---|---|
| `--no-spacedock` | Do not read workflow definitions or show their stage strips. Claude role metadata remains; saved stage conditions remain readable but suspended. |
| `--no-tripwires` | Do not read or write saved workflow stage conditions. |
| `--no-events` | Disable the event coordinator, event overlays and coarse store probe. Fixed-interval collection continues. Also disables terminal focus, command-shape reporting and reading/writing recorded session ends. Observation history is independent. |
| `--no-irreversible` | Disable hook command-shape matching, report ingress and publication. Ordinary lifecycle hints remain available unless `--no-events` is also set. |
| `--no-git` | Do not run end-of-session Git probes in session repositories. Dirty/changed fields stay empty; empty is not a finding that the tree is clean. |
| `--no-focus` | Do not record terminal identities, publish a focus capability or raise session terminals. `--no-events` also turns this off. |
| `--no-ask` | Disable session-to-reader questions: register, poll and answer routes refuse, and the page offers no ask control. |

### Notifications away from the desk

Reach nudges are off until a URL is configured. Quiet hours have no effect until a window is
configured. Both settings can come from a command-line value, environment variable or file;
see [Environment](#environment).

| Option | Behavior and default |
|---|---|
| `--reach-url URL` | HTTP or HTTPS webhook endpoint for counts-only nudges when sessions need input or finish unread while you are away. Overrides the environment and file settings. No URL is configured by default. |
| `--no-reach` | Refuse off-machine reach nudges regardless of any configured URL. Does not disable other notifications, quota fetches or model calls. |
| `--quiet-hours WINDOW` | Local 24-hour window, such as `22:00-08:00` or `13:00-14:00`. Suppresses non-ask notifications, unasked checks, workflow-condition notifications and reach nudges during the window. Conditions are still evaluated. Direct questions are exempt. Overrides environment and file settings. |
| `--no-quiet-hours` | Disable quiet-hours suppression for this run regardless of the configured window. |

A quiet-hours window includes its start and excludes its end; a window crossing midnight is valid.
Invalid windows or identical start/end times produce no suppression. An invalid selected webhook
URL produces no reach nudges. These are not command-line usage errors, and an invalid nonempty
higher-priority setting does not fall back to a lower-priority one.

### Experimental session interaction

These options configure a prototype. They do not open a session page or attach an arbitrary
terminal. Leave both unset for normal dashboard use. See the
[interaction limits](SECURITY.md#operator-cockpit-prototype) before configuring them.

| Option | Behavior and default |
|---|---|
| `--interaction-origin-session HARNESS:SID` | Select one exact, already-collected session identity for registered read-only terminal output. No session is selected by default. Must be paired with the registration-file option. |
| `--interaction-origin-registration-file PATH` | Write the one-use session-side tmux registration capability to this file. No path is selected by default. Must be paired with the origin-session option; session-side registration is still required. |

## Environment

Use absolute paths for directory overrides. A nonblank harness override is authoritative: Cargento
does not also search that harness's default directory. Diagnose the effective paths after relocation.
These are dashboard configuration variables; provider authentication and destination settings are
owned by the installed harness, as explained in [Security](SECURITY.md#observer-model-calls).

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CARGENTO_HOME` | Move Cargento's own state, logs and persistent stores. Default: `.cargento` under your home directory. Does not relocate harness transcripts. Use the same value for start, stop, status and forget. |
| `CARGENTO_REACH_URL` | Reach endpoint when `--reach-url` is absent; takes precedence over the `reach_url` file in the Cargento home. `--no-reach` overrides all sources. |
| `CARGENTO_QUIET_HOURS` | Quiet-hours window when `--quiet-hours` is absent; takes precedence over the `quiet_hours` file in the Cargento home. `--no-quiet-hours` overrides all sources. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Claude configuration root; Cargento searches `projects`, `tasks` and `teams` below it. |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Codex root; Cargento searches `sessions` below it. |
| `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` | Parent of `.gemini`, not `.gemini` itself. Relocates Gemini data and Antigravity data below `.gemini/antigravity-cli`. |
| `COPILOT_HOME` | Copilot store root. |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Pi configuration root; its `settings.json` and default `sessions` directory are resolved here. |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` | Pi session directory; overrides Pi's `sessionDir` setting and its default sessions directory. |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | Base for OpenCode and Goose data discovery. Defaults to `.local/share` under your home directory. |
| `LOCALAPPDATA`, `APPDATA` | Additional native Windows candidates for OpenCode and Goose; see the [platform contract](COMPATIBILITY.md). |

`CARGENTO_PORT`, used by hook and MCP clients, does not set the dashboard listener's port.
Pass `--port` to `server.py`; configure its clients to reach that same port using the
[setup procedures](HOW_TO_USE.md#move-it-ports-a-second-dashboard-and-where-state-lives).

## Files

The following files live in `CARGENTO_HOME`, or `.cargento` under your home directory. The list
covers instance control and the stores addressed above; it is not a complete inventory of caches.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cargento-PORT.json` | Per-port instance state, including process identity and capabilities. |
| `cargento-PORT.log` | Detached instance output and diagnostics. |
| `cargento-history.json` | Bounded observation history. |
| `cargento-ends.json` | Recorded session ends from the event coordinator. |
| `cargento-annotations.json` | Saved reader goals, outcome lines, readings and discard records. |
| `cargento-dismissals.json` | Sessions marked handled. |
| `cargento-tripwires.json` | Saved workflow stage conditions. |
| `cargento-copied-corrections.json` | Digests recording copied corrections, without their text. |
| `cargento-reading-permission.sqlite3` | Reading permissions and model-spend admission timestamps. |
| `reach_url`, `quiet_hours` | Optional plain-text defaults for reach and quiet hours. |

See [local-store security](SECURITY.md#scope) for retention, permissions and other persistent data.
Keep logs and state private when reporting a problem; they can contain local paths and capabilities.

## Platform notes

The same launcher supports macOS, Linux and Windows. Native notifications and terminal focus
depend on the platform and harness; see [Compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md).

On Windows, `--daemon` respawns the server and deliberately omits the model opt-ins
`--observer-model` and `--unasked-readings`. The experimental interaction-origin pair is also not
forwarded. Use foreground mode on Windows when you need those options. Feature-off switches,
port, host, display/history bounds, Claude model choice, reach URL and quiet hours are forwarded.

## Exit status

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Help or diagnosis completed; status found a running Cargento; serving ended normally; daemon startup or stop succeeded; or forget completed its reading-permission cleanup. `--stop` can succeed when no instance is running. |
| `1` | Status found no running Cargento, or startup/stop/forget failed or was refused. A foreign process is not stopped. |
| `2` | Invalid command-line syntax or rejected values/combinations, reported by the argument parser. |

Diagnosis can exit `0` while reporting missing or unreadable stores; inspect its report.
Forget prints separate outcomes for its stores: exit `0` alone does not prove every file was removed.

## Examples

Run these from the repository root. Replace `4581` with your chosen port. Options for a running
instance are fixed at launch; stop and restart it to change them. The examples refuse model calls
so browsing a session cannot start an analysis; omit `--no-observer-model` when you want disclosed,
reader-requested model analyses.

Show help or inspect discovery without starting a listener:

```bash
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --help
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --diagnose --json
```

Run in the foreground with a shorter display window:

```bash
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --window-hours 6 --no-observer-model
```

Start a detached instance, check it and stop it:

```bash
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --daemon --no-observer-model
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --status
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --stop
```

Keep three days of history with a 256 KiB cap and overnight quiet hours:

```bash
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --history-days 3 --history-max-bytes 262144 --quiet-hours 22:00-08:00 --no-observer-model
```

Refuse quota network fetches, model calls and reach nudges for the run:

```bash
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --no-usage --no-harness-usage --no-reach
```

After stopping every instance sharing the selected Cargento home, clear observed history and
reading permission while preserving typed annotations:

```bash
python3 cargento/skills/cargento/server.py --port 4581 --forget
```

`--help` reflects the copy you actually run; this manual follows the repository's current code.
