# Design: the modular dashboard runtime

Owner for how the dashboard's Python is arranged: which file owns what, which direction dependencies
run, and how one process's configuration, state and services are held. Other design documents own
their own subject and link here rather than repeating the module map.

The dashboard began as a single `server.py` of 7,357 lines. It is now a launcher of seven lines plus
an importable `cargento_runtime` package. This document records the arrangement and the reasoning, so
a later change either follows it or overturns it deliberately.

The materialized snapshot and the SSE stream have since landed as `snapshot.py` and `stream.py`, each
importing no runtime module so that `state` can own them without inverting R-2. `events.py` has landed
as the envelope and reducer layer beneath them, and `observation.py` as the coordinator that drives
it. The loopback ingress route and bundled event hook now feed that coordinator. The remaining
adapter and rollout work lives in
[`plans/event-driven-session-observation.md`](plans/event-driven-session-observation.md).

## The problem these decisions answer

One file that holds configuration, ten harness collectors, notification policy, HTTP handling,
process lifecycle and the frontend loader has no seams. Three specific costs made it worth fixing:

- Any change had to be reasoned about against everything else in the file.
- Tests reached for module globals, so a test's setup was coupled to the launcher rather than to the
  behaviour under test. Patching an alias did not necessarily patch the module that read it.
- Two dashboards could not run in one interpreter, because the caches, the notification state and the
  clock were process-wide.

## R-1: One responsibility per file, and the launcher owns none

`server.py` is the stable entry point every harness manifest names, so its content is a contract:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Launch the Cargento dashboard."""

from cargento_runtime.cli import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

One import, one call, no re-exports. `LauncherContractTest` parses this file with `ast` and rejects
any `def`, `class` or assignment, and `runpy` executes it under `__main__` to prove the guard reaches
`cli.main` and exits with what it returned.

Everything else lives in one file per responsibility:

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `project_context.py` | Read-only composition of one project: the observed-session evidence, the dispatch and subagent joins, the gate and captain-instruction events, the semantic projections it hands `semantic_history.py` to store, the Claude Code check and
written-path reader `claude_tool_reports` (called from `collect` only, so it never reaches the history
store), which reads the session's subagent transcripts beside the parent's, with the one shell-line parser it reads a Bash call through, `_ShellLexer`, which decodes
quoting before anything is matched or masked, and the bounded `spacedock status --discover` subprocess behind `discover_project_workflows`. The largest module in the package, and `http_api` reads it for `/api/project-context`, the reading route's record of one session, and `/api/direction`, which re-reads one message's whole text from the transcript tail through `direction_text`. The Claude collector also reads its bounded delegated-launch summary, publishing only counts, activity and completion times, and visibility. A user message's fact carries its whole `reader_words` beside its title for a reading's ledger, and `for_page` drops them from the context `/api/project-context` publishes. On Claude Code each top-level assistant text message is an `agent_message` fact read live from the tail by `agent_message_events` (from `collect` only, never into history), carrying its whole `agent_words` the same way and reserved last under the project event cap; `frozen_claude_agent_messages` is its frozen twin for an offline replay. Outside the runtime, `scripts/mark_abstention.py` calls `frozen_claude_checks` and `frozen_claude_user_messages` to freeze a Claude Code case and to rebuild it at score time. |
| `semantic_history.py` | Prototype semantic event history in the configured state directory |
| `interaction_prototype.py` | Optional exact-session tmux registration and read-only output |
| `config.py` | Immutable process configuration, store-root resolution, every tunable limit. |
| `state.py` | Mutable caches, locks, bounded-cache helpers, the server start stamp, and the runtime's published snapshot. Cache validity is not one rule. Of the twenty-five caches, twelve turn on a file's `(mtime_ns, size)`: nine carry it in the value (`claude_title_cache`, `claude_user_event_cache`, `codex_instruction_cache`, `claude_instruction_cache`, `codex_plan_cache`, `codex_analysis_cache`, `transcript_user_cache`, `conversation_cache` and `agent_start_cache`), `delegated_work_cache` carries the parent and admitted children's stamps together, and the Spacedock readme and entity caches carry it in the key. The readme key also checks device, inode and change time against replacements, and neither Spacedock cache stores a file modified within the last two seconds, since a same-size rewrite inside one timestamp tick moves none of that key. The other thirteen do something else. `metadata_cache`, `cwd_cache`, `agent_class_cache` and `spacedock_role_cache` key on a path and never stat it, because each holds a fact that is fixed once the file has it. `agent_start_cache` sits beside `agent_class_cache` over the same head bytes and is deliberately not in that group: a start stamp is fixed only once a file HAS one, so a transcript with no timestamp in its head yet is the one answer worth invalidating, and stat-keying is what makes remembering that null safe. `spacedock_boot_cache` keys on a path and holds a scan position beside its records, because a first officer does not necessarily boot at session start (S-7). `claude_subagent_cache` keys on a session directory and turns on directory mtimes, since appending to a transcript moves no directory. `cursor_metadata_cache` turns on an `st_mtime` float across four derived keys per store. `pi_scan` and `turn_scan` hold an incremental scan position rather than a validity stamp. `usage_fetch_cache` and `usage_receipts` key on a vendor name and stamp the fetch time. `spacedock_discovery_cache` keys on a canonical project root and stamps the observation time for the same reason, and it is the only one of the thirteen guarding a subprocess rather than a file read: a second `spacedock status --discover` is held off for thirty seconds. `dispute_episodes` keys on `(harness, sid)`. Most are bounded at `max_cache_entries`; the two quota caches are bounded by the vendor list, and `dispute_episodes` by the sessions the current collection saw. The two instruction caches are honest about what they do not buy: the key moves on every event, so they never hit for a live session, and they exist for the idle and `?all=1` rows re-read on each refresh. |
| `snapshot.py` | The published response bytes per variant, and the restart-qualified revision that versions them. Each `clear` moves a generation, and a body collected across one is answered to the request that collected it but not kept. A collection reads its stores near its start and publishes seconds later, so without that a reader's save was overwritten by the pre-save words with a fresh stamp and the saving page's own refresh was served them until the next poll (DRC-4760). Imports no runtime module, which is what lets `state`, `aggregate` and `http_api` all depend on it without a cycle. |
| `stream.py` | Connected SSE clients and their one-slot revision mailboxes, with the connection budget. Imports no runtime module, for the same reason `snapshot.py` does not. `state` owns the registry because a connected stream belongs to the runtime, not to whichever object serves a request. |
| `asks.py` | Every outstanding `ask_operator` question and its one-slot answer mailbox, with the pending budget, the expiry sweep and the shutdown decline. Imports no runtime module, for the reason `stream.py` does not: `state` owns the registry because an outstanding question belongs to the runtime rather than to whichever request serves it, and a leaf is the only shape that lets `state`, `aggregate` and `http_api` all reach it without a cycle. It therefore cannot call `records.safe_text`, so every text bound is applied at the `http_api` ingress and it stores what it is handed. See [design-ask-lane.md](design-ask-lane.md). |
| `io.py` | Bounded file reads, safe globbing, read-only SQLite, the diagnostic sink. Globbing comes in two shapes and a caller must pick the right one: `glob_under` and `glob_stores` build a sorted match list for a reader that wants the paths, while `any_glob_under`, `any_glob_stores`, `any_store_dir` and `existing_stores` answer a predicate and stop at the first hit. A `discover()` that reaches for a sorting reader pays for a list nobody reads, and `collect()` repeats the same walk moments later. It also owns `held_file_lock`, the one cross-process lock: `reading_jobs`' recovery pass and every annotation write take it. |
| `probe.py` | The coarse store probe: a bounded stat sweep answering whether anything on disk moved. Stat only, no globbing or reads, and a hint rather than authority. |
| `focus.py` | The focus command: the per-field grammars, the three argv templates and their fixed slots, and one function that resolves the volatile half of a target at the raise and then declines or switches. The durable half is three fields, not two: the socket name, the pane, and the pid of the tmux server that reported them. A pane id is an ordinal on one server, so without the pid a target survives a server restart and names an unrelated pane. A leaf beside `git_status.py` and for the same reason: it imports no runtime module and holds no state, so the coordinator can call it from a handler thread without ordering concerns. **What it does not have is a store.** The target lives in an in-memory map on the coordinator, so only a session that posted an event to *this* server run can be focused at all; a session that predates the run is unfocusable until it emits another one. That is a limitation of the design rather than a gap in it: the contract says nothing is written to disk by this feature, and a persisted target would also be a target resolved once and reused, which the same contract forbids. Its bounds are a security contract, not a preference: see "Reaching a session's terminal (the focus command)" in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). |
| `git_status.py` | The end-of-session git probe: one fixed argv, a porcelain entry count, and two scalars or `None`. A leaf: it imports no runtime module and holds no state, so the coordinator can call it off-thread without ordering concerns. Named `git_status.py` rather than `gitprobe.py` because `probe.py` above already owns "the coarse store probe", and two names a letter apart in one package is a reading hazard. Its bounds are a security contract, not a preference: see "Repository git reads (the end-of-session probe)" in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). |
| `history.py` | The local history of what the server observed: the store's path, its bounded read, the append, the age-first then size-cap eviction (which runs on every collection, since a store nothing appends to still has to expire), and the discard-on-unreadable read. A leaf over `config`, `io` (for the shared owner-only write helper; DRC-4345), and the pure `records` scrubber, added with DEC-22 so first-prompt history is redacted before its load-time bound. The collection lane writes this store continuously; it reaches no application or mutable runtime state. So `io.diag` is inlined and the diagnostic sink is a parameter. It also owns the recording lane's `Lane`, injected at assembly rather than reached through the overlay source, which is `None` forever under `--no-events`, and attached only on the serving path, so `--diagnose` reads the stores and writes none of its own. Its bounds are a security contract, not a preference: see "Local history (the session history store)" in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). |
| `observation.py` | The event coordinator, and the only module that owns a long-lived one. It starts the collection worker and, on a session end, one short-lived git probe thread; `quota.py`, `http_api.py` and `lifecycle.py` each start one of their own for a single task, and `reading_jobs.py` starts one per pressed reading. Owns the bounded overlay ledger and pending map, the per-session completion marks it holds outside that ledger (N-9 in [design-needs-input.md](design-needs-input.md)), the dirty generations, the end-of-session git readings it holds outside that ledger for the same reason and retires on the same edges, the observed session ends it holds outside that ledger and retires only once the row is gone from the collected set **and** the end is a display window old, both conjuncts, so a session still being collected keeps its mark however old the end is (a session fires `session_ended` once, so a mark pruned early can never be re-earned: see N-12 in [design-needs-input.md](design-needs-input.md)), the focus targets it holds outside that ledger and retires on neither, one collection lane, the collection floor, the coalescing window, probe-gated periodic ticks, the reconciliation interval and deterministic shutdown. The focus targets are bounded by a clock rather than by a collection's row set, because a target is a durable fact gathered once on `session_started` while a completion mark is display state that comes back with its row. The git probe is dispatched from here and deliberately runs neither on the event-ingress thread nor under the coordinator lock: that edge arrives on an HTTP handler thread behind the hook client's two-second timeout, so an inline probe would stall every other event and time out the harness's own session-end hook. The dispatch is gated by an in-flight set, claimed under the lock and released in a `finally`, on the pattern `quota.py` uses per vendor and the focus command already reuses here. Two gates on one set, because the cadence bounds neither: one probe per session key, so a redelivered or looped session end cannot put one repository under several, and `git_probe_max_inflight` across every harness, because the session id a claim is keyed on is a payload field. Its bounds are a security contract, not a preference: see "Repository git reads (the end-of-session probe)" in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). It also holds the one seam an outstanding question uses to demand a collection, because a question that nothing collects is a question that never renders and never expires: see A-3 in [design-ask-lane.md](design-ask-lane.md). Constructed inert so a coordinator built before the daemon fork is never inherited half-running; `lifecycle.serve` starts it after the last fork. |
| `irreversible.py` | Fixed command-report vocabulary, published report shape and bounded current-run memory ledger. A leaf with no runtime imports, held under the coordinator lock and read through `OverlaySource.command_reports`. It survives hint coalescing and session end, never enters durable history, and has no input-reading or matching code. [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#irreversible-actions-hook-side-destructive-shape-matching) owns its limits. |
| `events.py` | The untrusted event envelope: its accepted version range, its vocabulary, per-harness identity normalization onto the collector's key, the mapping from event to overlay, and the reducer that turns live overlays into a field patch. Pure by design, so ordering and precedence are testable without a server: no locks, no counters, no clock and no filesystem. The mutable pending map and overlay ledger belong to the coordinator that bounds them, not here. |
| `records.py` | Parsing and normalizing untrusted records from disk, and the one place the repo-wide ISO-8601 rule lives: `iso_epoch` decides that an **offset-less stamp means UTC**, and the transcript, SQLite, quota and event readers all defer to it. That rule was four separate copies until two of them disagreed, so it is stated once here and imported rather than reimplemented. It also holds the scanner's harness-gated record signals: `model_signal` reads the model a Codex `turn_context` record declares, `usage_signal` reads output tokens from a Claude assistant record, and `tool_outcome` reads the tool a Claude record calls and whether it came back an error. `mask_words` masks, word by word, the command-line credential forms that have no shape (`NAME=value`, `-p` and `--password` values, `user:pass@`) before a Claude Code check line is redacted and bounded, and `masked_values` returns the raw text it replaced, so the check's output tail can drop the same values before it reaches a prompt. `scan_turns` runs over five harnesses' transcripts, so every signal refuses a record from the wrong harness rather than turning a shared type or shape into a false measurement. The same gating shapes `injected_prompt`, which answers whether a user record is the harness talking (a skill body, hook feedback, a compaction summary) rather than the operator: Codex names its wrappers with underscores and Claude with hyphens, only five names are common to both, so there are two measured lists and an unmeasured harness gets their union. Beside it, `harness_control` answers the narrower question of whether a RENDERED directive drives the harness rather than the work (`/clear`, `/login`), and it lives here rather than in either caller because `observer.py`'s goal slot and the instruction line beneath a session title publish the same reading of the same directive; two lists would be two chances to disagree. `instruction_line` bounds a published line at the cap plus one, because `transcripts.clip` appends its ellipsis after cutting and a scrub at the cap takes the marker back off. `redact_secrets` sits beside them and is the one place credential shapes are named: it is called from `safe_text`, so nearly every published string is covered by passing through the bound it already had; from `redact_clip`, which is redact-then-bound in that order for the collectors that slice `title` and `last_prompt` out of a record by hand; and from `aggregate` over the assembled rows, as a backstop under both. Its shape list carries per-shape corpus counts the way `injected_prompt` above does, and [`design-credential-redaction.md`](design-credential-redaction.md) carries the measurement and the rejected alternatives. `strip_prompt_wrappers` peels the image markers first, because those envelope a real prompt rather than replacing one, and the slash-command wrappers (`<command-message>`, `<command-name>`, `<command-args>`) are absent from both lists for the same reason: a slash command is the operator's intent spelled in harness markup, and `transcripts.prompt_title` already owns reading it back out, so the two primitives agree about one record instead of contradicting each other. |
| `sessions.py` | Session identity and shape, freshness, display ids, deterministic aggregation. The row's declared field set is `base_session`, and three contracts hang off it: `MODEL_CAP_CHARS`, the width every collector bounds a published model to, `TOOL_NAME_CAP_CHARS`, the wider width a published tool name gets, and the `subagents` element shape, `{"name": str, "model": str \| None, "started_at": float \| None, "active": bool \| None, "parent": str \| None}` with every measurement key always present. `active` is that element's own liveness and `parent` the member that spawned it; Claude measures both and every other collector publishes None on both, which says unread rather than idle and parentless, so the frontend reads None as live and only False withholds the pulse and the running count. `instruction` is declared there too, as a label, a text and a stamp or None, rather than folded into `last_prompt`: different overview and detail surfaces need the source label beside it rather than an unexplained line packed into another field. So is `source_gaps`, the readings a collector could not take from a store it opened, named from the `UNREAD_*` vocabulary in the same file so five collectors cannot spell one reading five ways; [design-unread-sources.md](design-unread-sources.md) owns why that fact is published on the row rather than routed through the store-error boundary. `acquisition` and `blocked_since` are declared there too, and neither was until the declared-field-set test stopped reading `base_session`'s return value and started reading a published row; [design-scan-only-rows.md](design-scan-only-rows.md) owns both halves of that. One exception to the determinism above: `bounded_project_label` probes the directory tree, because the name Claude encodes flattens `/` to `-` and the string alone cannot say which dashes were separators. It reads only `isdir` under the configured home, caches per encoded directory, and fails closed to the dash form, so an unreadable tree resolves nothing rather than merging two projects that are genuinely different. |
| `transcripts.py` | Shared metadata readers, prompt titles, the non-Claude analyzers, and the instruction line beneath a session title. `antigravity_direction` is the only reader of Antigravity's brain transcript: it keeps a `USER_INPUT` from `USER_EXPLICIT` and nothing else, and `observer.resolve_directions` hands that file to it alone, never to a reader of work (DRC-4689). `codex_instruction` walks a rollout backward for its newest genuine prompt, because a bounded tail read misses that prompt on 62% of the rollouts that carry one, and `instruction_from` turns the candidates into the one labelled line both harnesses publish. `states_work` is the pairing rule for `records.bare_continuation`, and it reads two different things off one prompt: the RENDERING decides the shape, since a slash command is sixty characters of markup that reads back as a five-word instruction, and the tag-stripped BODY decides the word count, since `prompt_title` returns line 1 only and counting there called 97 of 2,066 local newest prompts bare over a real instruction. `command_direction` decides whether a Claude Code slash-command record is a reader direction in the observed record: a prompt command, which opens with `<command-message>`, is rendered by `prompt_title`, and a local command, which opens with `<command-name>`, or a `records.harness_control` name is not one (DRC-4764). `harness_control_prompt` is that refusal on its own, and `states_work` and the observer's goal slot ask it too. The preamble it pairs with is bounded structurally rather than by the turn floor alone: only a record newer than the newest genuine prompt can supply one, because reaching a `task_started` proves that some turn opened and not that this one did. `codex_plan` is a second backward walk over the same file for a different record, and it has its own cache entry because the two stop in different places: it reads the newest `update_plan` and publishes it as the session's task rows. It reads both live wire shapes, since a Codex build writes one or the other and a single-shape reader reports an empty plan on the other one: across 487 local rollouts the `function_call` shape accounts for 279 plan records and the `exec` shape, which carries the plan as JavaScript source rather than JSON, for 211. All 490 parse, including the 6 that bind the array to a variable before the call, which is why the array is located directly instead of through the `update_plan(` call site. The JS rewrite is a string-aware scan and not a set of substitutions, because a step reading `Recce Task 7: full Recce verification` is ordinary and a naive rewrite corrupts exactly that. Unlike the prompt walk it crosses a compaction boundary: a compaction disowns an older prompt, but the plan is state the CLI keeps rendering, and stopping there would blank the panel for the long sessions the field exists to make legible. |
| `turns.py` | Generic incremental turn scanning and turn display, including the model a Codex rollout declares, the failed tool calls inside the current turn (Claude only: `records.tool_outcome` is where that gate lives), output-token totals, and a transcript's first timestamp. The failures are counted three ways: the consecutive run and its peak, which a success resets, and the request totals of failed and successful calls, which no success resets. The scan state carries `first_ts` and `scanned_from_zero`; crossing the unscanned-delta budget makes the latter false for that entry, so a bounded tail or rebuilt oversized entry can never publish its later first record as the session start or a partial lifetime token total. The current-turn token total has a separate completeness guard and stays withheld until the forward scan observes that turn's opening boundary. That same guard now withholds the two request totals, because both describe a whole request and one of them, whether nothing succeeded, is a claim about what did not happen that no partial view can support. The peak run is not gated: consecutive failures actually read are consecutive failures whatever preceded the bytes. The model and the run reading still use the backward context pass, while the start, the token totals and the request totals deliberately do not. |
| `claude_data.py` | Claude transcript reads shared by the collector and the hook path, including the model a session ran on and the one each of its sidechain children ran on, kept apart because the `isSidechain` flag inverts between the two. It also reads a child's start stamp: the first record inside the bounded head that carries a timestamp, which is not record 0. Claude Code 2.1.259 opens a top-level transcript with untimestamped control records, so the stamp sits at index 3 on seven of the eight freshest transcripts measured and at index 0 on every legacy `agent-*.jsonl`, and a one-line read returned nothing for every teammate dispatched into its own pane. The scan reuses the head budget the subagent classifier already reads over the same files and falls back to the one-line read, so no transcript that reported a start can lose it; `st_birthtime` was rejected as macOS-only. Both answers are memoised on the file's own `(mtime_ns, size)`, the null included, because the published roster reaches past the freshness gate and a quiet agent otherwise paid the head read and the fallback on every collection. mtime remains last activity and never substitutes for a start. `session_instruction` is the Claude half of the instruction line, walking backward beside `session_title` because that title is generated once from the opening prompt and never refreshed. `has_conversation` keeps a top-level transcript out of the session list when every record in it is `ai-title`, `agent-name` or `pr-link`, the files Claude Code leaves without a session (DRC-4645); it reads the same bounded head, never classifies a longer file, and keeps session-start records such as `mode` and `permission-mode` because an unprompted session writes exactly those. |
| `spacedock.py` | Spacedock workflow and entity cartography. `tool_result_text` is the provenance gate the whole read surface rests on: a boot envelope counts only when it arrives as command output, and it does that in three transcript shapes, one per harness. Codex's is a `function_call_output` or `custom_tool_call_output` payload, which is why it was missing for so long; see [`design-spacedock.md`](design-spacedock.md) decision S-6 for the measured payload shapes and what accepting a `function_call`'s arguments instead would have cost. Provenance settles where an envelope may come from, not what it looks like there: S-7 records that no real session pastes the raw JSON, so the envelope is also read as the key/value rendering a session printed, under the same `command: boot` gate and the same downstream guards. |
| `observer.py` | The on-demand observer: goal, current stage and one open block for one named session, written to a sidecar under `~/.cargento/observer/`. A reader above `spacedock` and `transcripts` rather than beside the collectors, because it answers about one session a person asked about and a collector answers about every session there is. Its default path derives rather than summarizes: the stage comes back through `read_entities`, so the freshness window and the declared-stage discriminator the project-read contract rests on both apply, and `--no-spacedock` withdraws that half exactly as it withdraws a strip. The transcript half reads three record shapes, not one: a nested `message.role` under `type: "message"` (Pi and Droid), `type: "user"`/`"assistant"` (Claude), and a `message` payload under `type: "response_item"` (Codex). The union is additive and takes no `harness` argument, because the three are disjoint across the whole local corpus and the caller has already resolved one file for one requested harness. It could not ship without `records.injected_prompt`, which every user record now goes through: the parser alone published a harness-injected shape as the goal on 51.2% of 457 Codex rollouts and 61.8% of a seeded 400-transcript Claude sample, which is a confident wrong answer in place of the silent one the unfixed parser gave. What survives is rendered by `transcripts.prompt_title`, so a slash command, the one shape that predicate deliberately admits, reads as `/name args` rather than as its wrapper. Sidechain records are excluded on the Claude arm, since a subagent's prompt is its parent's dispatch and not the operator's, and the Codex path excludes the same thing one level up: a subagent thread writes its own rollout under its PARENT's session id, so the transcript resolver drops subagent rollouts before it picks the newest file, the order `collectors/codex.py` already does it in. Two directives are refused rather than published: a generic skill-load opener, read on the raw text, and a bare harness-control slash command (`/clear`, `/login`, `/plugin`), read on what `prompt_title` renders, since the raw and rendered spellings of the same record never meet. The control list lives in `records.harness_control`, shared with the instruction line beneath a session title so the two surfaces cannot disagree about whether `/clear` is an objective, and it is measured names and not the structural rule "a bare command has no arguments, so it has no goal": a skill invoked with no arguments is an objective, and 39 local goals are exactly that. Refusing a directive leaves the one beneath it standing, so a `/clear` typed after real work does not erase it. The head and tail windows are cut apart on byte offsets rather than concatenated and deduped, because the two overlap on any file smaller than their sum and the dedup key falls back to the message text on the 76.4% of Codex user records carrying no `payload.id`, which dropped a verbatim-repeated prompt as a duplicate of its own first occurrence. Disjoint windows make that fallback positional, and the key is left to do the one job it is good at: collapsing a resumed transcript's replayed block, which carries its original ids. The block half is a keyword scan over the newest assistant message only, and the table is self-state phrases rather than bare words, with a trailing word-boundary test so `waiting for you` stops matching `waiting for your`: on the whole local Claude corpus the bare forms produced 7 blocks of which 4 sat in a quoted or fenced span, two of them clipped so the card showed no block language at all. A false block is the one field on the panel a reader would act on, so precision wins over recall by construction. |
| `tripwires.py` | One saved stage condition per exact workflow, the bounded durable store, current-observation baselines and persist-before-notify latches. Imports only config, state and deliveries within the runtime. Collection runs before handled rows are filtered; HTTP mutations use expected revisions. See [workflow stage conditions](design-tripwires.md). |
| `quota.py` | Quota acquisition: the per-vendor credential reads and outbound requests, the receipts a harness pushes in, the shared cache with its per-vendor floor, and the bounded in-memory ring of successive window readings the recent-pace figure is measured from. The quota outbound surface (see [design-usage-quota.md](design-usage-quota.md)); the opt-in observer model is a separate path. |
| `annotations.py` | The goal and the expected outcome lines (up to six, each with its source, and an `entry` source only `add_direction` mints) the reader typed against one session, as immutable numbered revisions, in a store a write trims to its read limit. Shaped on `dismissals.py`: the same four imports for the same reason, plus `reading.py` for the shape of a stored assessment, which is the one edge `dismissals.py` has no equivalent of. It departs from that module's behaviour in one place: there is no watermark. A dismissal lapses when the session moves again, because "I have handled this" is answered by later activity; an annotation does not, because later activity is the thing it exists to be read against. Bounded by a session count and a revision count rather than by age, so a session still on the board cannot lose what was asked of it because time passed. `aggregate` puts the published shape on every row, and `http_api` mutates it. One entry shape carries no revisions at all: a discard record, holding the moment a reader discarded everything and the last revision number that went, and no text of any kind. It is what makes absence, presence and discarded three answers rather than two, and it is the only thing in this store `cli.py`'s `--forget` removes. Every write, `--forget`'s sweep included, reads, checks and renames under `_locked_store`: a per-store writer lock for this process, then an OS lock on `cargento-annotations.json.lock`, then this state's `annotation_lock` once both are held, so two dashboards on one home write one at a time (DRC-4661, and the rejected alternatives below). `fresh` reads the store under the same locks for a reading press about to hand an entry to the model, and `refresh`, which reads outside them, leaves this process's copy alone when a save committed during its read: every locked write moves `state.annotation_generation`, so a collection that read first cannot put an older copy over the save (the refresh race behind Keep over a draft finding no entry). |
| `reading.py` | One reader-requested reading of a session against the words typed against it: the evidence ledger, the prompt, the reply parser, and the rules that decide what may be said. Over `config`, `records` and `observer`, and it reaches no store, route or collection: the caller hands in a published row, an annotation and the observed facts. The model is a selector rather than an author, so it sees a numbered menu the code built and returns tokens and integers. `annotations` imports it for the shape of a stored reading, which is why the arrow runs that way: the shape belongs with the producer. It also holds the one-in-flight slot and, beside it and under the same lock, the registry of pressed readings running as jobs (DRC-4686), because the unasked lane takes that same slot: the slot stays the one guard, and a job is only ever the reader's half of it. `reading_jobs` runs `produce`. |
| `reading_jobs.py` | The thread a pressed reading runs on (DRC-4686). `http_api` starts the job in `reading` and hands this module a closure that calls `produce`; the thread tells the job each real phase from the seams it passes through (the reservation, the CLI's spawn, the reply), publishes a revision for each by clearing the snapshot and collecting, writes the outcome to `annotations`, and only then ends the job and frees the slot. It owns `cancel`, which the cancel route calls: the flag is set in `reading` under the slot's lock, the group is killed without waiting, and the outcome is decided at a seal just before the write (DRC-4693). It owns the restart marker written before the reservation and `recover`, which `lifecycle.serve` calls at start with `pid_exists` injected and which asks `reading_policy.charged` whether each left job was charged (DRC-4713). The application it runs over is a protocol, so it never imports `aggregate`. |
| `supervise.py` | The runner every model call goes through: `subprocess.run`'s keywords plus `on_spawn`, with the child in a process group of its own (a kill-on-close Job Object on Windows), that group killed on a timeout while its leader is still unreaped, a refusal to signal the daemon's own group held at the one call to `killpg`, `Group.cancel` for a reader's Cancel, which the call's own wait sees within a poll and reaps with the same bound, `kill_all` for shutdown, which closes the runner under the spawn lock so nothing spawns after it, `admitting` for a reservation that must commit wholly before or wholly after a shutdown (DRC-4712), and `output_limit`, which kills the group as a Cancel does once the output file passes its bound and raises `OversizedError` (DRC-4667). A leaf that imports nothing from the runtime, so the kill guard depends on nothing else. `observer.codex_exec` and `observer.claude_exec` default to it, which is how the goal lane, the unasked lane and a pressed reading all get it. |
| `copied_corrections.py` | The digests of corrections the reader copied (DRC-4678): the normalisation both sides share, the store's path and its bounded, locked write, and the matching that re-reads a Claude Code transcript from where each copy was made (incrementally, at most its newest 32 MiB) and recomputes each user message's fact id as `project_context.direction_text` does, so the collector module frozen with the abstention qualification is not edited. A recognised message's fact id is written back to the store, so it stays recognised once the tail moves on. `aggregate` attaches the recognised messages to each row as `copied_prompts`, each naming the row's prompt fields that quote it (`quoted_as`, placed by fact id), `http_api` marks those facts `copied` in the two contexts the page and the reading route read and registers a copy through `POST /api/correction/copied`, and `reading.author_of`, `reading.typed_window_start` and `annotations.prompt_candidate` (through `reading.prompt_copied`) read the mark, so rule 7, the window and adoption stay one rule; the page's `nextPromptCopied` and `nextReadingCopied` are the same two checks. The unasked lane reads neither. `cli.py`'s `--forget` deletes the store. |
| `correction.py` | Steer back's correction (DRC-4681), composed without a model and stored nowhere: the owner's template filled from a session's published row (the saved goal and lines, the stored reading of those words, the settlement and the window start) and its observed record, each line's state re-derived with the page's rules for whether a verdict survives, and each cited entry written as its time plus an `{"entry": fact_id}` placeholder the page turns into "#n". It reads no summary, command, check name, output or reading detail. Over 2,000 characters it drops consistent lines, last first, then refuses. `http_api` serves it as `POST /api/correction`, passing `annotations.direction_floor` and whether the route can carry checks; it imports only `copied_corrections` (the cap and the Claude-only harness set) and `reading`. |
| `dismissals.py` | The sessions the reader marked handled: the store's path, its bounded read and write, and the rule that decides when a mark lapses. A leaf beside `records`: `aggregate` subtracts through it before `summary` is counted, `notifications` gates a popup on it, and `http_api` mutates it, and none of those three could depend on it if it depended on any of them. See [design-dismissals.md](design-dismissals.md). |
| `deliveries.py` | What became of each notification the board raised: the store's path, its bounded read and write under a module lock, the five outcome tokens, and the sentence each one earns. Shaped on `dismissals.py` and a leaf for the same reason, since `notifications` writes it, `aggregate` publishes it and `http_api` writes the browser half through `POST /api/lane`. Durable rather than in memory, because the reading is later than the write by design and a restart in between is the expected case. The wording is the product here: one sentence per outcome and never a shared one, and none of them says a person saw anything. It owns the sentences for an absent raise too, which are true only beside a departure and are printed nowhere else, since a session nobody was raised about draws no panel at all. `published` takes a lane, and a caller that narrowed to one producer gets the narrowed wording, because a sentence that counted one lane may not be worded as if it counted every one. Measured on the board before that argument existed: a departure block printed that no raise about the session was on record while the notifications block directly beneath it counted one, both about the same session, one counting one lane and the other four. See [DEC-19](design-reading-a-session.md#dec-19-the-page-may-report-a-lane-never-a-delivery). |
| `reading_policy.py` | The remembered reader-requested permission, one answer per provider, the tool-output grants keyed by provider and destination in a table of their own, the content version and destination each Allow was given under in `permission_disclosure` (`CONTENT_VERSION`, so a press that carries the agent's messages needs an Allow given under the disclosure naming them, and the unasked lane and other harnesses read at `WORDS_CONTENT_VERSION`), and the twelve-attempt rolling budget they share. SQLite transactions admit concurrent tabs and processes before the model seam, and each charge commits with its job's id in the `spend_jobs` ledger, kept 30 days, which `charged` reads for recovery (DRC-4713); off and forget revoke every provider without refunding unexpired attempts. The Codex answer keeps the original single-row table, so an answer saved before there were two providers reads as Codex's. Over config and optional SQLite loading in `io`, plus `supervise`, only to refuse a call before its reservation while Cargento is stopping and to commit the charge under the lock the shutdown takes; independent of the goal-summary browser consent. |
| `reading_route.py` | Who reads a session: the one provider a reading of that harness reaches on this machine, or the reason none can, with the disclosure the page shows before the press, and, on the harness whose record lists checks, where tool output would go as configured on this machine or that it cannot be named (`destination`). It reads each provider's gate in `annotations` before looking up its CLI, and pulls model ids from `observer`. A base URL is named by its host only where the CLI's URL parser and `urlsplit` cannot read different hosts from it, and never where `records` finds a credential's shape (consent F1, ui5). It never starts a model. `aggregate` publishes one route per harness on the board, and `http_api` resolves it again for each press. See [DEC-21](design-reading-a-session.md#amended-2026-09-23-claude-code-is-built-and-gated). |
| `levels.py` | The four drift levels of [DEC-26](design-reading-a-session.md#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn), from two sources, as two pure functions that call no model and store nothing. `live_level` reads a Claude Code session's published `tool_report` facts and full-scan counts beside the reader's saved intent, and has no level over an unsaved draft. `analysis_level` derives the level from a stored reading's per-line results, reading the same facts only to learn what each citation points at. Each returns closed reason tokens and the fact ids behind them, so a page can say why without a rule of its own. It imports `reading` alone, for the producer's result sentences, `why` tokens and outcome-line names, `live_estimate.py` feeds `live_level`, and `http_api` calls `analysis_level` over the stored reading on every focused project-context fetch (DRC-4695). `rose_from` finds where a run of levels last rose, for the live estimate's "Rose from". `scripts/levels_cases.py` measures both against the owner's marks ([docs/drift-levels/](drift-levels/README.md)). |
| `live_estimate.py` | The live drift estimate for one Claude Code session (DRC-4696), with no model, no process and no write. It replays the parent and delegated calls through the same private check scan, result pairing, call order and tally as `project_context`'s published record. It asks `levels.live_level` after each of the last `LIVE_REPLAY_STEPS` (64) writes, shell calls or Agent, Task and Monitor calls, so the level now comes from that record and "Rose from" comes from the current replay (`levels.rose_from`), withheld when the rise is older than the window or its fact has left the published list. An unchanged parent and child inventory reads no transcript content. Changed inputs refresh the bounded scan. Replay marks include both the check's parent-first result and the launch's own stream result, and a late parent or admitted child completion changes the replay context. An exact appended prefix or safely removable old head reuses normalized tally state and evaluates the current window. Ambiguous changes take the fresh path. Same-key requests share one computation, and the in-memory replay retains neither raw result blocks nor output tails. Changes to `project_context` remain in DRC-4666's qualification digest. Later directions are counted by `correction.unsettled_directions`, the rule Steer back uses. `http_api` publishes the answer as `sources.work.live_levels` on the focused `/api/project-context` only, never on a row or on `_session_context`, which the reading route and the unasked lane read. The analysis-derived level rides beside it as `sources.work.analysis_levels`, under the same rule. |
| `departures.py` | Every unasked check the lane ran, and the baseline each read against: the annotation revision, the moment the reading ran, and the producer's own account of what it read, all recorded at check time because none of them is recoverable by the time the reader comes back. Every check and not only the ones that found something, because a check that found nothing still spent a subprocess and a store of findings alone bounds nothing. A leaf shaped on `deliveries.py`, with the write lock and the per-thread temp name from its first commit rather than after the same measurement. It also owns the four sentences that say why there is nothing to show, which is what stops a spent cap reading like a board with nothing to raise, and a session nobody checked reading like one that was, and it chooses between them: the ladder lives here rather than in `unasked.py` because the review surface and the Intent log both need it and neither may reach the lane. Being a leaf is what makes one input a parameter: whether anything is typed against the session now cannot be asked of the annotation store from here, so both callers pass it, and neither may default it. A check outlives the words it read, and a check with nothing behind it earned the not-checked sentence rather than the nothing-found one. And it derives what a later check found about a raised constraint, from later checks in this same store rather than from a second model call. That is not only the cheap route, it is the only one available: a reader-requested reading carries its evidence cutoff as the producer's own sentence and not as a number, so nothing on it can be compared with a departure's cutoff. The store's own `cutoff` cannot be compared either (both write sites record the wall clock at the check, so it bounds the evidence from above and is the same number as `at`), and the sentences therefore say that a later check RAN and never that it read newer evidence. Unknown is the default and arrives as a named reason, and no sentence has a causal clause, because a return to the goal is not evidence the raise worked. Clearing an annotation reaches this store too: `withdraw` blanks the quotations from the rows those words were read against and keeps each row for the spend it made, which is what makes `SECURITY.md`'s claim about a clear true of a route that serves both stores. |
| `ends.py` | The session ends this board observed, kept so a restart does not forget them: one record per session id with the harness's own stamp, written through by the coordinator on the `session_ended` that sets its in-memory mark and removed on the same three edges that lift it, and read back by `aggregate` onto a row whose coordinator never saw the end. A leaf shaped on `departures.py`, lock and per-thread temp name included, over `config`, `records` and `io` alone: the writer and the reader are joined only by the `OverlaySource` protocol, and a store either depended on would give that pair a real edge. Absence means not observed and never "did not end", exactly as it does in the coordinator's memory; the coordinator is the only writer, so `--no-events` leaves the file unread and unwritten and `--forget` deletes it. Its bounds are a security contract, not a preference: see "Session ends" in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). |
| `unasked.py` | The lane [DEC-18](design-reading-a-session.md#dec-18-an-unasked-reading-is-permitted-and-gated-on-delivery-first) permits: check an annotated session against what the reader typed without being asked, and raise a departure. An orchestrator rather than a leaf, and its own module rather than an `Application` method, because it reaches `reading` for the producer, `project_context` for the evidence, `annotations` for the baseline, `departures` for the record and `notifications` for the raise, and `aggregate` imports neither of those last two halves. It reaches `reading_policy` and `reading_route` too, for the one Allow binding a press reads: each send is asked, at the model seam, whether a press would send without a new Allow, and is skipped and logged where it would not (consent F5, ui5). Nothing runs on the collection thread: `consider` does dictionary work and hands the reading to a worker, as `quota.request_fetch` hands a network read to one. Attached only when `record_history` is true and the switch is on, which is how `--diagnose` runs a collection without starting a subprocess. |
| `reach.py` | Off-machine nudge delivery: webhook resolution from command line, environment, or store file; strictly bounded payload formatting with count scalars only; lock-protected cooldown throttling; and redirect-free POST dispatch. Used by `aggregate.py` during periodic collection when configured. |
| `notifications.py` | Hook state, popup policy for both lanes (needs-input and ask), the native notifier, hook payload handling. The notifier reports one of `deliveries`' five outcomes rather than `None`, and each lane spends its cooldown floor before the call and refunds it when the outcome says there was no lane to attempt. The hook lane's repeat suppressor is not refunded: it exists so one standing gate is not counted twice, and that reason does not change with the outcome. |
| `collectors/*.py` | One harness each: a discovery predicate and a collector. Two of them, Cursor and Antigravity, reach a value through a bounded read inside a stored blob rather than off a column, and both bound the read in SQLite (`substr`) so the whole blob is never materialized. Each also owns the boundary *below* the per-harness one `aggregate.py` holds: a raise inside one row's build costs that row, and a raise outside one costs that store, so neither reaches the boundary that badges a harness. [design-unread-sources.md](design-unread-sources.md) U-5 owns the scope rule and the argument for it. |
| `aggregate.py` | `HarnessSpec`, the registry and its label lookup, the per-harness failure boundary, and `Application`, including the one place a needs-input popup is decided: after the overlays have been reduced onto a row and before a dismissed row is subtracted (R-5). It is also where what the reader typed is attached to every row, annotated or not, and where a stored `final` reading is retracted to `withdrawn` once the row it was taken on no longer reports an end. Both are derived at publish time rather than stored, so both correct themselves in either direction. |
| `diagnostics.py` | Store-path reporting for `--diagnose`. |
| `http_api.py` | The loopback server, request dispatch, project-context model-consent gate, optional vendored-asset routes, and network helpers. It reads the departure store directly on one route, `/api/annotations`, because the Intent log serves sessions that have left the board and the polled payload holds only the ones still on it. |
| `lifecycle.py` | State file, port probes, status, stop, and daemon detach. The Windows respawn argv forwards every `--no-*` switch the parser put in the namespace, derived rather than listed ([D-2](design-daemon.md#d-2-windows-re-spawns-instead-of-forking-and-waits-to-be-sure)). `serve` also records what a stopped dashboard left spent (`reading_jobs.recover`) before serving, and kills every supervised group (`supervise.kill_all`) first on the way out. |
| `cli.py` | Argument parsing, runtime assembly, and the three serve branches. |
| `frontend_dev.py` | Contributor-only immutable development manifest, owned Vite challenge verification, fixture-root containment and development document assembly. A standard-library leaf used by configuration and CLI assembly; it imports no application or request-dispatch module. Production pages never use its module URLs. |
| `web/page.py` | Package-relative asset loading, the font table the build reads, strict React artifact/integrity/license verification and content identity. It also keeps the frozen `APP_PARTS` and `load_script()` of the retired page, for the paused study's source binding only: nothing the server serves reads them. Startup passes verified pre-capability bytes into `Application`, which publishes their digest as the board's `build` (prefixed `react-`). |

`aggregate` also imports `observer` for its bounded, read-only cached-goal projection. One
`read_sidecar` call per published board row admits scrubbed `deterministic_goal`, or `goal` with
explicit deterministic provenance, into the declared `cached_deterministic_goal` field. No-goal
sentinels and malformed or absent evidence yield `None`. The projection keeps a valid observation
time when present, never resolves a transcript, and never invokes analysis or writes a sidecar.
The dashboard also publishes the existing Spacedock switch so its absence is distinguishable from
a workflow with no title. See [Intent log freshness](design-reader-state.md#intent-log-freshness).

The prototype also gives `observer.CodexGoalModel` an optional goal-summary path through the
installed Codex CLI. It is disabled by default and requires scoped disclosure consent for an
explicit focused project-context refresh. `frontend/src/capacity/ObserverControls.tsx` owns the Console
disclosure, separate consent state and explicit summary request; passive reads do not request the model. The
redaction, prompt byte cap, executable resolution and concurrency limits are owned by
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#observer-model-calls), alongside the dispatch and terminal boundaries.

The dashboard page is built, not assembled at startup. The React sources under `frontend/src` (repository
only, never shipped; Node and pnpm are build tools) are packaged by `frontend/build/package.mjs` into one
self-contained page, and the server verifies and serves those fixed bytes. The `next-*` prefixes that remain
in class names, `data-next-*` attributes and the `cargento.next.*` browser keys are retained from the
retired interface's preview period to avoid a mass rename; they do not indicate a second bundle.

| Frontend file | Owns |
|---|---|
| `web/react.html`, `web/react.integrity.json`, `web/react-licenses.txt` | The tracked self-contained page, its deterministic integrity/provenance bindings and full bundled-code/font notices. `pnpm build` writes them and `pnpm build:check` fails when they differ from a clean build. Installed Python verifies and serves fixed bytes. |
| `web/page.py`, `web/styles.css`, `web/fonts/` | The font table, the `@font-face` rows and the embedded Space Grotesk and IBM Plex Mono subsets with their licenses and source hashes, which the build reads and embeds in the page. |
| `web/vendor/` | The vendored xterm build, its stylesheet, its license and its source record. Not embedded in the page: the terminal loads it lazily from `/assets/xterm.js` and `/assets/xterm.css`, which `http_api` reads out of this directory and serves only while the interaction prototype is running. |
| `web/next-*.js`, `web/project.js` | The twenty script parts of the retired page, frozen byte for byte for the paused Intent and drift study, which evaluates their text and binds the digest of `load_script()`. Not served, not rendered, not read by the runtime or the frontend; removing them needs the study rebound first. |
| `frontend/src/{api,store,transport,storage}` | The typed client, the one external immutable store, the runtime owner of requests, timers, the event stream and leader election, and the one browser-storage layer. Components never fetch, poll or touch `localStorage` themselves. |
| `frontend/src/{router,shell,controls,styles}` | The fragment grammar, the shell (primary navigation, header counts, notices, live regions), the shared controls and the reader-state lanes behind them (focus, field memory, disclosures, the display gate), and the page's CSS tokens. |
| `frontend/src/{observed,workstream,delegation,attention,notify,capacity}` | The observed model and its Attention, notification, quota and delegation readings. Pure functions over one accepted payload, plus the views that draw them. |
| `frontend/src/{sessions,project,timeline,terminal,steering}` | The Sessions screen and session page, the Projects list and project page with its Now, Course, Decisions and Console tabs, the timeline and its filter, the output-only terminal, and the project's steering controls. |
| `frontend/src/{intent,drift}` | The Intent log and panel, and the Drift section with Analyze, its consent, the result, Steer back and the departures. |

The HTTP server serves the verified page bytes at `/`, including the supported `all=1` view.
It rejects the retired `next` query with 404 instead of preserving a second page URL. The promotion
decision, retained browser namespace, and route grammar live in
[design-next-ui.md](design-next-ui.md).

The [React frontend record](design-frontend-migration.md) owns the frontend's boundaries, the
behavior inventory it preserved and the browser measurements.

## R-2: Dependencies run inward, and the test enforces it

Lower layers never import higher ones. `config` imports no runtime module at all; `cli` may import
any, because it is the assembly point.

`test_runtime_import_graph_matches_the_reviewed_allowlist` parses every runtime file with `ast`,
normalizes each import to a top-level runtime module, and compares the result to an explicit
allowlist. Two rules matter more than the table:

- A collector may not import another collector, or `aggregate`. Collectors take `Session` from
  `sessions.py`. Ten independent files each testable alone is the property that makes adding a
  harness cheap.
- `TYPE_CHECKING` imports count. A dependency that exists only for annotations is still a dependency
  a reader has to follow, and exempting it would make the allowlist describe less than the truth.

The whole-final reply identity repair adds an inward edge from `project_context` to
`events`, whose pure identity normalizer already maps native Claude UUIDs to collector
keys. Sharing it keeps lifecycle and transcript identity checks aligned; duplicating
its prefix rule in project composition would create a second identity contract. The
lookup still verifies the full native filename and each parent record, rather than
treating a matching shortened key as proof that two parents are the same.

The allowlist changes only in a PR that makes a reviewed ownership decision, never to make the test
pass. Two edges arrived that way with the per-session model. `claude_data` gained `sessions`, and
`collectors/cursor` gained `records`, because each bounds a model string through `records.safe_text`
at the width `sessions.MODEL_CAP_CHARS` declares. Neither is a layering break: `sessions` imports
nothing from inside the package, and every collector already depends on it. The alternative was a
second literal 40 beside the declared one, which is how two caps drift apart.

A third arrived with the credential filter. `aggregate` gained `records`, because several published
strings do not reach `records.safe_text` on the way out: nine collectors build `title`,
`last_prompt`, `state_detail` and a subagent name out of the transcript by hand and bound them with a
slice. Codex is the exception and was described as though it were not: its title and prompt come
from `transcripts.codex_instruction`, which bounds both through `safe_text` like everything else.
Aggregate is the one place that holds every row from every harness before any of it is published, so
the sweep runs there rather than in ten collectors and whichever one is added next. `records` is a
leaf, so the edge points inward like the other two.

`collectors.claude` and `collectors.droid` gained the same edge later, and for the ordering rather
than the coverage: the sweep above cannot repair a shape the slice has already cut short, so the
redaction has to run before the bound at each of those sites. `records.redact_clip` is the one place
that order is written down. See
[`design-credential-redaction.md`](design-credential-redaction.md).

## R-3: The runtime package is imported by its top-level name

`cargento_runtime.io`, never `cargento.skills.cargento.cargento_runtime.io`. Two spellings would give
every module two identities in `sys.modules`, and therefore two copies of every cache and lock: a
write through one spelling would be invisible through the other. The validator rejects the
namespace-qualified form in any runtime file, and a contract test asserts the qualified package never
appears in `sys.modules`.

Frontend assets load relative to `web/page.py`, so an installed copy needs no repository and no
working directory. A contract test walks the package with `pkgutil` from an unrelated directory, with
`PYTHONPATH` removed and `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`, and proves every module's `__file__` and every declared
asset path, including the page's font subsets, resolve inside the skill directory. It
inspects every module it finds rather than a maintained list.

## R-4: Configuration is frozen, state is mutable, services are injected

Three objects, with deliberately different lifetimes:

- **`RuntimeConfig`** is a frozen dataclass built once at the process boundary. It carries the
  resolved store roots, the platform and OS names, the state home, and every limit and threshold.
  Nothing downstream reads the environment, `sys.platform`, or `os.name`.
- **`RuntimeState`** holds what genuinely changes: bounded caches, scanner offsets, locks, hook and
  popup state, the collection memo, and the start stamp.
- **`Application`** binds one config and one state to injected services: the native notifier, the
  popup notifier, the diagnostic sink, and the clock. It owns the registry and the per-harness
  failure boundary, so one broken store cannot take the dashboard down.

`CargentoHTTPServer` stores exactly one `Application` and one mandatory page. Its handler reads
both off the server instance. `cli.main` loads the renderer selected by frozen configuration and
passes its verified pre-capability bytes into the application. A selected load failure is fatal
before bind, with no substitution or build-tool launch. The process keeps that page and identity.

The payoff is testability of the awkward cases. Platform decisions take their environment as an
argument (see D-4 in [design-cross-platform.md](design-cross-platform.md)), so one runner exercises
the Linux, macOS and Windows branches. And two servers can run in one interpreter without crossing: a
contract test proves `/`, `/api/data`, `/api/health`, `/api/overlays` and notification POSTs each
answer only for their owner, including that a `SessionEnd` on one leaves the other's standing hook and
generation untouched, and that an event submitted to one server's coordinator stays out of the other's
ledger.

`RuntimeConfig` carries `state_home` as a string alongside `state_dir` as a `Path`, because a native
`Path` rewrites separators on Windows: an override of `C:/plugin/state` would come back as
`C:\plugin\state`, a different string in `--status` output and in the dirname contract lifecycle
relies on.

## R-5: The registry is data, and no collector notifies

`aggregate.default_harnesses()` returns ten `HarnessSpec` rows in display order, which is also
collection order and the order the page renders its harness chips. Each row names a collector
module's `discover` and `collect`, and declares what that harness can report: `reports_rate`, `reports_needs_input`, the optional `reports_needs_input_when` qualifier on a mechanism that can be switched off, and an optional `usage` provider with `usage_is_fetch` beside it. No row names a notifier.

`Collector` is one contract for all ten: `(config, state, now, window_hours, show_all)`. A collector
reads a store and returns rows. It does not decide whether the human should be interrupted, because
it cannot: by the time a row is final, two more things have happened to it. The live event overlays
have been reduced onto it, and the reader's dismissals have not yet been subtracted. `Application`
is where both of those are known, so `Application.collect` walks the rows once, after
`_apply_overlays` and before the subtraction, and asks `notifications.maybe_popup` about each. `cli`
passes the same notifier to `Application.popup_notifier` that the hook route uses, so the transcript
path and the hook path cannot diverge.

This overturns an earlier decision, and the reason is worth keeping. Claude's collector used to
raise the popup itself, and `default_harnesses` took a notifier to bind that one row. The argument
was that a transcript-detected transition has no HTTP request behind it, and that widening the
contract for all ten to serve one was the worse trade. It was, until DRC-4184 gave a second harness
a gate: `maybe_popup` had exactly one production caller, so on macOS, where `native_notifier` names
a backend and the browser layer therefore stands down, a Codex session at a real permission prompt
alerted nobody at all. The premise the one-layer split rests on, that the server already fired for
whatever the page declined to, was true of Claude and of nothing else. Binding a second collector,
and then a third, would have restated the same defect once per harness. Moving the decision up also
closed a second silence that was true even for Claude: the popup read the collector's state, and
`_apply_overlays` runs afterwards, so a wait that only an event knew about raised nothing.

One property of `maybe_popup` survived the move unchanged and must keep surviving it: its
`expect_generation` is re-checked under `hook_lock`, so `Application` samples every session's
generation before the harness loop and hands that snapshot in: reading the live map at decision time
would compare a value with itself and let a `SessionEnd` that committed mid-collection be undone by
a popup for a session that has exited.

A second property had to change with the move. The transition is recorded into `last_session_state`
*above* the cooldown gates, so a popup the machine-wide floor suppressed used to be consumed rather
than deferred: every later collection then failed the edge test, and that gate was silent for as
long as it stood. That was survivable while Claude's collector was the only caller and only Claude
rows wrote the floor. It is not survivable with ten harnesses contending for it: the first gate of
a collection would permanently eat any other opened within 15s, and registry order decides which
harness systematically loses. So a transition held by the floor alone is now left unrecorded and
retried on the next collection. `popup_cooldown_sec`, the per-session re-emission floor, still
consumes: retrying past it would re-pop the same standing gate every minute. The ask lane keeps its
own floor key either way (D-3 in [design-cross-platform.md](design-cross-platform.md)).

Adding a harness is therefore: a module under `collectors/`, and a row. `CONTRIBUTING.md` owns the
walkthrough, and [design-harness-registry.md](design-harness-registry.md) owns the judgement of what
earns a row of its own, including the one time that judgement had to be revisited.

## R-6: The three serve branches stay distinct

There is deliberately no generic "bind before detach" rule, because the three paths differ in what
owns the bind:

1. **Windows daemon parent** validates its state home and log, re-spawns a foreground child, and
   awaits that child's pid. It never constructs a server: the child owns the bind, and therefore owns
   reporting a bind failure. A test substitutes the server constructor with a failure and proves the
   parent never reaches it.
2. **POSIX daemon** binds in the attached process, then forks. Binding first is what lets a busy port
   explain itself on the terminal that asked, rather than in a log file nobody has been told about.
3. **Foreground** binds, records state, and serves in the same process.

`cli.main` returns exit codes rather than raising, except where argparse owns `SystemExit` for
`--help` and its own usage errors. That is why `lifecycle.prepare_daemon_home` reports whether the
home is usable instead of raising.

All three branches assemble the coordinator without starting it, and `serve` starts it. That is the
whole reason `Observation.__init__` spawns nothing: on the POSIX daemon path the process that
assembles is not the process that serves, and a thread created before the fork is either lost with the
parent or inherited into a child that never asked for it. `serve` runs the coordinator or the older
fixed-interval producer, never both, so two things can never collect at once; a server assembled
without a coordinator, which is what `--no-events` and most test doubles are, gets the producer.

## Rejected alternatives worth keeping rejected

### One large package-first change

A single move would have combined module identity changes, hundreds of patch-site updates, asset
loading, CI discovery, packaging validation and daemon imports. A failure would have been hard to
locate, and review would have mixed moved code with changed behaviour. The work went out as
sequential behaviour-preserving PRs instead, each with its own gate.

### Splitting only tests and frontend assets

Quick context-size relief, but it leaves roughly 5,800 lines of unrelated Python in `server.py` and
postpones the dependency problem entirely.

### A permanent `server.py` re-export facade

Re-exporting every constant and function would have kept tests coupled to the launcher, and patching
an alias does not necessarily patch the module that reads the value, which is the exact failure the
split was meant to remove. The facade would have become a second mutable API and an invitation to import
cycles. A transitional facade did exist *during* the split and was deleted with the last extraction;
that was scaffolding, not a design.

### Hard line-count enforcement

A numeric gate rewards artificial fragmentation and wrapper files. Responsibility and dependency
direction are the architectural checks; line count is a review signal. Review a module over about
1,000 lines by hand, and split it only if it holds more than one responsibility.

### Deriving the shipped-file inventory from a glob

`CARGENTO_RUNTIME_FILES` in `scripts/validate_plugins.py` is an explicit tuple. A glob would describe
whatever happens to be present and could never notice an omission, which is the only thing the check
exists to catch. The cost is that the list can fall behind, so a test compares it against what the
checkout actually ships.

### A per-state lock, a SQLite store, or a rename claim for annotations

The annotation store is written by every dashboard sharing one Cargento home, and until DRC-4661 each
write held only `state.annotation_lock`, a `threading.Lock` on one `RuntimeState`. Every writer
already re-read the file under that lock, so one process never lost a save, which is why the defect
survived: a second dashboard is a second state, and its lock never met the first one. A writer paused
after its read let the other dashboard commit revision 1 and then renamed its older revision 1 over
it. Two real processes making 30 saves each ended at revision 30 of 60.

The fix is the OS lock `reading_jobs` already took for its recovery pass, moved to
`io.held_file_lock` so there is one helper and not a third mechanism. It dies with its process, so it
has none of the stale-lock problem `docs/design-dismissals.md` rejected a lock file for, and its
Windows branch was already measured on the `windows-latest` runner. The lock file sits beside the
store rather than being the store, because the store is replaced by a rename on every write and
Windows refuses to replace a file another handle holds locked.

Under the lock each writer decides a stale read exactly as it already did in one process, so no new
answer was needed. A guarded write (a replaced outcome list, `add_direction`, Keep, any write naming
`expected_revision`, an adoption's empty-goal check) is refused as stale when the other dashboard got
there first. An unguarded goal save appends after the other dashboard's revision, so both revisions
stand and neither number is used twice. A write that waits ten seconds for another holder writes
nothing and answers `unwritable`.

A write takes three locks in a fixed order against one ten-second deadline. First comes a writer
lock this process keeps per store, so only one thread here asks the OS at a time. Next is the OS
lock, with whatever the first left of the wait. Last is this state's `annotation_lock`, held only for
the read, the check and the write.

The writer lock exists because the OS lock does not always exclude threads. Local `flock` and
`msvcrt.locking` belong to the handle, so two opens in one process conflict. Linux NFS clients
emulate `flock` with POSIX locks, though, and a POSIX lock belongs to the process: a second thread's
open "gets" the lock its sibling holds, and whichever thread closes first releases it to the other
dashboard while its sibling is still between its read and its rename. Modelled by routing `flock` to
`lockf`, two processes of eight threads lost 6 to 23 of 160 stored saves per run with the OS lock
taken per thread, and none with one OS-lock user per process. That is the documented kernel
behaviour, modelled rather than measured: no NFS mount was available.

`annotation_lock` comes last because the first version took it first and waited for the OS lock
inside it. One stuck holder in another dashboard then queued every writer here behind the first
one's wait, and `refresh` and `active` behind all of them: three saves answered at 10, 20 and 30
seconds and the board stalled for 30. The writer lock is never `annotation_lock`, so readers do not
wait on it, and a queued save waits on it only for what is left of its own deadline. Each waiting
save still costs at most one wait. A writer called from inside another writer on the same thread
raises at once, rather than waiting out its own lock and blaming another dashboard.

A lock file that exists, or can be made, but refuses this user is a refusal, not a fallback: the
write answers `unwritable`. Proceeding there wrote without exclusion and said nothing, and two
processes behind a mode-000 lock file answered `stored` 60 times and kept 38. Only a filesystem that
reports it has no locks (`ENOLCK`, `EOPNOTSUPP`) proceeds under the in-process lock alone, because
refusing there would refuse every save, and the dashboard logs that once. A home whose directory
cannot take the lock file at all (a read-only home, a file where the directory should be, a home
deleted mid-save) keeps the words for this run and answers `unwritable` without writing. It used to
go on to the write and rely on that failing too, but the write makes its own directory, so a home
that vanished between the two succeeded with no lock over another dashboard's store. Running out of
descriptors is not that case and stays a refusal. Windows has no such
answer to read: its C runtime reports every `LockFile` failure as `EACCES`, which is busy, so an
unlockable filesystem there refuses after the wait. The recovery pass still runs behind a lock file
it cannot use and on a filesystem without locks, because its rename claim holds on POSIX without it.

Rejected:

- SQLite, which the permission store uses. It would move the reader's words out of a JSON file whose
  read limit, kept-raw entries for a newer build, discard records and `--forget` sweep are each an
  owner ruling on that format, to fix a race that needs only exclusion.
- The atomic rename claim `reading_jobs` uses for a marker. It decides who owns a file that already
  exists; it cannot make a read, a check and a replace one step, and on Windows it is not exclusive.
- Leaving it last-writer-wins, as the dismissal store does. A lost dismissal costs one click; a lost
  save here is words the reader composed, and a reused revision number re-points every reading that
  cited the old one.

## Testing strategy

Three layers, described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Two habits specific to this architecture:

- Prefer pure functions that take their environment as an argument. It is what keeps a new platform
  branch from being dead code on the runner that gates the merge.
- Mutation-check a new contract before trusting it. Across this split, mutation testing found real
  gaps in behaviours the plan explicitly required preserved, including both popup cooldown floors,
  the clearing of `store_errors` before a diagnosis, and whether the registry's Claude row notified
  through the notifier it was handed. Each had passed a full green suite.

## The browser derivation seam

`frontend/src/observed` builds one `Observed` model per accepted payload and shares it: `observedFor`
caches by body, so a poll that changed nothing costs nothing and a subscriber that selects it gets the
same object back until the data is replaced. The header, counters, session lanes, projects and Attention
coverage all count this model's session collection. Working means collector state without an observed end;
running also requires the event-published `active` flag. Subagents in the header are observed, including
quiet ones. A session has one primary Attention category: waiting on the reader, then risk, then closure.
Its secondary evidence stays on the session even when waiting takes precedence. An exact request
keeps its project active and in the waiting rail even if collector state has gone idle; the count
line still describes the published state, so its state buckets do not count that session twice.

The delegation figure measures evidence the tab holds. `frontend/src/workstream` keeps a bounded
observation ledger (`createWorkstream`), seeded from the published `history` field and extended by each
accepted payload, and `frontend/src/delegation` reads it through `projectWindow`, `metricOf` and `trendOf`,
wrapping the measurements in text and evidence flags. A payload cannot contain the observations this tab
retained between revisions, so demanding payload-only input for the live board would discard a shipped
measurement. The payload-only path (`payloadEvidence`) is deterministic and neither path mutates the
ledger. The delegation percentage describes the observed working-or-gated intervals, without claiming that
missing intervals were delegated. Only a partly measured token rate receives the lower-bound sign.

`attentionModel` in `frontend/src/attention/model.ts` is a second pass on each accepted payload. It owns the
subject identities, exact-request options and replies, secondary tool and termination details, upcoming
project actions, quota sub-limit subjects, coverage disclosure details, accessibility announcements,
and focus fallback targets. The Attention renderer uses those subjects for controls and details
and omits subjects already represented by its risk rows. Session detail and project plan helpers
also read published source records for surfaces the observed model does not carry, including
Spacedock, instruction provenance, source coverage, task totals and controls. This is a retained
adapter boundary, not a completed migration. Removing the pass requires moving those capabilities
and their behavioral checks together; deleting it now would remove supported interactions.
