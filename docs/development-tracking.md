# Development tracking

This file owns the roadmap labels and move taxonomy. It is a development record, separate from
[what Cargento promises a reader](promise-map.md). The promise map, the Visibility 2x2 board's
Promise row and the Linear project overview carry the same five promises. The in-repository check
allows the board's initial capital where the map continues a lowercase sentence; the tracker copy
is checked by hand. Build order and issue state live in the
[Cargento: Actions Front and Center project](https://linear.app/recce/project/cargento-actions-front-and-center-eed1852b11e6/overview).

Internal labels belong here, in development records and in PR traceability. User-facing docs and
release notes describe behavior without tracker names, issue keys or tracker links, under
[the repository publication rule](../AGENTS.md#public-documentation-and-release-notes).

## How work links to a promise

Every unit of roadmap work names the promise it serves and how it touches it. The link is two
labels on the Linear issue and a two-sentence **User value** section at the top of its body: who
notices this and when in their day, then the promise ID and the move. The
[burndown workflow](roadmap-burndown/README.md) requires the section at triage and reads the labels
at selection.

| ID | Question | Linear label | Board column |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Which of my agents are running? | `journey:open-sessions` | `open` |
| P2 | What is it doing, and when should I come back? | `journey:mid-flight` | `mid` |
| P3 | Is anything waiting on me? | `journey:stopped-at-gate` | `gate` |
| P4 | Will I hit the wall before the work finishes? | `journey:usage` | `usage` |
| P5 | Did anything die quietly? | `journey:end-of-sessions` | `end` |

The five labels and the five columns predate the IDs. Nothing was renamed to make this table.

The move says how the work touches its promise.

| Move | Meaning | May change the promise map |
|---|---|---|
| `keep` | Without this, the board says something untrue about the promise. Most defects land here, because the limits are part of the promise. | No |
| `sharpen` | The promise is kept and this makes it more precise, or covers one more harness. | No |
| `extend` | A new clause on an existing promise. | Yes, that promise |
| `new` | Territory no promise covers. Today that is only the Move up a level milestone. | Yes, a new promise |
| `none` | No user-visible effect. The issue says why, and the Linear project overview counts these so the share stays visible. | No |

A decision issue names the promise its ruling unblocks or forecloses, and takes the move of the
work it gates.

Only `extend` and `new` may change what the promise map says. A `keep` or `sharpen` merge changes no
wording here, and a burndown that closes one says so in its report.
