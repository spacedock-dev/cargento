# Reading a session against what you asked for

Cargento lets a person type what a session should achieve and what it should produce, then shows
that beside what the record says. Whether it may go further, and say something about how the two
compare, is a product question rather than an engineering one, and it was settled by four rulings
rather than by code.

This file is where those rulings live for the code to cite. They were made on the Cargento
Visibility 2x2 roadmap, now closed, and their full arguments stay on its issues, but a runtime
comment cannot cite a tracker, and the shape contract below is not background: three of its rules
are built into the producer rather than checked after it.

For what each runtime file owns, see [the module map](design-runtime-architecture.md). For what
survives a redraw, including the unsent drafts in these fields, see
[the reader-state inventory](design-reader-state.md).

## DEC-15: the floor and the overlay

Two permissions, and they are not the same permission.

The floor needs no authorisation. The words a person typed, the directive the deterministic
observer retained, the observed work evidence and the end outcome are shown side by side, with
their sources and their limits. Nothing compares them. The reader does.

The overlay is a model reading of that evidence against those words, and it happens only when the
reader asks for it. Evaluation on a cadence is refused, so there is no always on drift indicator
and nothing evaluates in the background. A verdict on whether the work met the request is refused
too, which is why the shape contract below governs something narrower than "was this met".

The ruling also asked for an evaluation rubric before automatic assessments are enabled. That
sentence is the one DEC-17 had to read carefully.

Amended 2026-09-23: a Drift mark read from a stored record is not the indicator this section
refuses, because it evaluates nothing on a cadence. [DEC-20](#dec-20-the-first-screen-shows-goal-beside-direction-and-drift-has-one-home)
says why and what may show it.

### Amended 2026-09-24: a live estimate runs after every turn

[DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn) amends this section and its
2026-09-23 amendment. A live drift estimate is computed after every turn, which is evaluation on a
cadence, and it shows a level in the Drift section and the session header. It uses no model: it
reads the checks and file paths
[DEC-23](#dec-23-a-claude-code-sessions-record-of-its-checks-may-show-the-work) admits against the
reader's saved intent. The switch that shows it is off by default and lives in the browser only, so
off hides the level and the pill; it does not stop the server computing the level. The level never
reaches a row, a total, a notification or the unasked lane. The overlay is still a reading the
reader asks for, and a verdict on whether the work met the request is still refused.

## DEC-15b: an assessment may be stored

An outcome assessment and the annotation revision it read persist in session history, so both
reopen after a restart and after the live row leaves the board. That is what makes the feature
useful the morning after rather than only while the tab is open.

The price is paid rather than avoided. Each stored field gets its own named admission in the
history allowlist, appears in the prompt derived carrier inventory, is redacted before it is
bounded, inherits the existing history bounds and retention, and is deleted by the existing forget
path. No new store, and no field admitted by implication.

### Amended 2026-09-10: the store is the annotation store

The ruling above names session history and gives its reason in the same sentence, so both reopen
after a restart and after the live row leaves the board. Measured afterwards, the annotation store
already does both. It is bounded by two counts with no time to live, and an annotation is keyed on
harness and session id with no project, so it outlives the row by construction. History was named
before anyone checked.

A reading is stored beside the revisions it read. Nothing in the paragraph above about redaction
survives unchanged only by luck: the one model authored field goes through the same redact before
clip scrub the two typed fields do, on the way in and again on the way out, because any local
process can rewrite the file.

Two consequences, both accepted rather than discovered. The forget command deletes session history
alone and does not reach this file, so a reader who wants a model authored reading gone clears that
session, which deletes the reading with the words that produced it. And there is no fourteen day
expiry: a reading is evicted when its annotation is.

What this avoided is worth recording because the alternative looked cheap. Admitting the five
reserved names to history needed five new flat published row fields first, plus the allowlist
entries, plus the schema bump. The obvious way to write that bump refuses every store already on
disk, and one test would have caught it.

One hazard was worth recording because nothing in the tree caught it, and it is now closed.
`history.py` returned a reset whenever the stored version did not equal the running build's, unlike
the dismissal store. The version bump that comes with the first admission would therefore have
discarded fourteen days of every existing user's history on upgrade, silently: the store rebuilds
itself from the next collection, so a wiped history looks like a quiet morning.

`history.READABLE_VERSIONS` is the closed set of versions the build can read. An admission bumps
`SCHEMA_VERSION` and appends the old value there. Every admission is additive, because each field
is re-validated on its own and a record written before a field existed is a record with that field
absent. A version outside the set is still refused, which is the case the reset header exists to
report.

Two fields are admitted, and five more are named without being admitted.

Admitted: `annotation_goal` and `annotation_output`, the words the reader typed, with
`annotation_revision` beside them. That is the baseline a reading is read against, and it is what
lets the baseline reopen after a restart and after the live row leaves the board. The annotation
store keeps the current annotation, bounded by a session count and a revision count; history keeps
what was true at each transition, bounded by fourteen days. Those are different questions and the
second is the one a retained assessment needs.

Admitting them cost a published-row change first, because this store may hold nothing the live
snapshot does not already serve and the allowlist admits field names rather than paths into a
mapping. The row published `annotation` as one nested object; it now publishes fifteen flat
`annotation_*` fields, and one helper in the bundle rebuilds the object the renderers read. A
nested carrier is also the shape the store's own tests ban for `tasks`, `subagents` and
`spacedock`, and for the same reason: a name cannot reach inside one.

The transition comparison widened with them. History appends on a change rather than on a sample,
and comparing `state` alone would have held the old words until the session happened to move again,
which makes the store's copy stale by construction.

Named and not admitted: `assessment_at`, `assessment_cutoff`, `assessment_revision_read`,
`assessment_goal_result` and `assessment_output_result`. Nothing produces a reading, so no row
serves them and the store may not hold them. The names are recorded here and in SECURITY.md so the
change that admits them does not re-argue the naming, and each still needs its own allowlist line.

### Amended 2026-09-12: a stored row says why it is not verifiable

A stored reading has to mean the same thing when it is read back later, and six of its demotions
did not. A constraint never put to the model, a departure the rules demoted for citing nothing,
rule 4's backstop and rule 7's three all stored as `not verifiable from available evidence` and
nothing else, which is what a model that said `unverifiable` on its own leaves behind too. Rule 2
is the exception, and it was measured rather than assumed: a reply that could not be read stores no
`result` at all, so the page tells that row apart without help. The page was right on screen, because
it derives the limit from today's harness table, and wrong in the store, because a reading re-read
after that table moved rendered a never-asked constraint as a model verdict.

Each criterion now carries `why`, a token from a closed set the producer owns: empty when the
result is the model's own, otherwise the rule that withdrew it. The page maps a token to a sentence
it already owns rather than printing it, so this field is not a second route for producer prose.
Tokens rather than sentences was the call, and it was made on the same ground the shape contract
stands on: the page's own re-derivation stays authoritative, and a stored reason fills only the gap
that derivation leaves.

This is the second downgrade cost stacked in one release, beside `revision_read_at`. Both land in
the same release on purpose: no shipped release carries either, so a reader stepping back meets one
refusal, not two. The refusal is the existing one. A build that does not know the key refuses the
reading whole, publishes `reading_refused` beside the press count, and writes the raw reading back
untouched, so stepping forward again reads it. A reading stored before the field reads back with
the reason absent, which is a reading with less in it, not a diverged one; a token this build does
not know refuses the reading whole, like every other bad value in the store.

### Amended 2026-09-24: an intent revision and a reading hold more

[DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
adds stored items, each taking its own admission under the rules above: a revision's window start
beside its save time (item 13), its outcome lines with each line's source (item 3, flat per-line
fields in the history copy), a reading's `evidence_through` (item 6), and a digest of each copied
correction, bounded per session (item 9). It adds one token, the reader's Not accurate mark on a
reading, stored with the annotation entry and removed with it, never sent and not reached by
`--forget` (item 10). It also changes when a reading may run: a session waiting at its prompt after
a turn stop may be read through its last turn (item 13).

The outcome lines cost a downgrade, and this one crosses a shipped release: v0.27.0 stores one
`output`. A build that old reads a revision holding lines as one with no expected output, and its
next save writes the lines away. It refuses a reading keyed by line and keeps it verbatim, as it
refuses any reading it cannot read. The owner accepted the loss on 2026-09-24. Going forward, a
revision or reading stored with one `output` reads as one typed line and is written back as lines
by the next save. The history copy carries up to six line fields where it carried one, so an
annotated session's records are larger and the size cap ages other sessions out sooner. The owner
accepted that too.

The larger store costs a second downgrade, and the owner ruled on it on 2026-09-24: the read limit
stays at 16 MiB. A build that old refuses a store over 2.5 MiB as unreadable, and its next save
writes every session's saved words away, not only the lines. This build does the opposite: a store
it cannot read whole, whether unreadable, over its limit or not JSON, is never written over, and
every save answers `untrusted` until the file is readable again, and the board says so in place
of "nothing typed". A missing store is not that state; it is empty and takes the first save. One
session's entry that this build cannot read, such as seven lines or an unknown source from a later
build, is kept as it was: it is written back unchanged, and a save, adoption or discard of that
session answers `unreadable` rather than renumbering it from revision 1.

The window start (DRC-4679) costs less, because the revision field is optional. A build without it
drops `window_start` from a revision on its next save, and that revision then opens at its save
time, which is what every build did before. A reading is different: it carries the key
`window_start` and may carry the scope token `last-turn`, and a build that knows neither refuses
the reading whole and keeps it verbatim, the existing refusal. It lands in the same release as the
outcome lines, so a reader stepping back meets that refusal once. A withheld reason this build adds
("This session stopped its turn moments ago...") reads back as no reason on an older build. The
session publishes `annotation_window_start`, a scalar time, and it is not admitted to
`history.OBSERVATION_FIELDS`: nothing in history reads it yet, so it stays out, as `settled_at`
does.

## DEC-16: Cargento does not write into a session

A departure is raised to the reader and nowhere else. Cargento does not write into an agent, and
the steer box holds a note in the reader's browser rather than sending one. Automatic correction is
withheld, including when a later instruction contradicts the annotation: that is an unresolved
baseline conflict for the person to settle, not agent drift for the board to declare.

### Amended 2026-09-24: a correction you copy, and a later direction you keep or add

[DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
amends this section in four places, and Cargento still writes nothing into a session. It composes a
correction without a model, from your goal, your outcome lines with their state and the cited entry
numbers and times, for you to edit and copy (item 7). Sending it into the session stays refused;
DEC-25, the follow-on that would decide that, is not ruled (DRC-4698). Before an analysis, an
unsettled later direction is still detected and not judged: "Keep my intent and analyze" settles
every one of them, as "The baseline still applies" does, and "Add it to my intent" puts the
direction's raw text into a new outcome line for review (items 4 and 8). A later message that
matches a correction you copied is not an unsettled later direction (item 9).

### What is detected, and what is not

Built 2026-09-10. The distinction is the whole of the block, so it is written down rather than left
in the code.

**Detected: that you gave a later direction.** A person-authored entry in the observed record whose
time is after the revision you last saved and after anything you have already settled. Both halves
are available without a model: the annotation carries an epoch, every fact carries its own, and
`nextReadingPersonAuthored` already owns the authorship question, so rule 7 and this cannot
disagree about who wrote a row.

**Not detected: whether it conflicts.** Deciding that a later instruction contradicts a typed goal
is a reading of two prose strings, which DEC-15 refused and DEC-18 permits only behind four
preconditions that are not met. So the block asks and the reader answers. A block that claimed to
have found a conflict would be the false claim this whole tab exists to avoid, and the word
conflict does not appear in anything a reader sees.

Amended 2026-09-23: [DEC-20](#dec-20-the-first-screen-shows-goal-beside-direction-and-drift-has-one-home)
labels this block "Conflict to settle", decided knowing it breaks the sentence above. The label puts
a question to the reader and records no finding: what raises it is still any unsettled later
direction, the detected superset, and nothing reads whether the two strings disagree. A block that
claimed a contradiction was found remains refused.

**The suppression keys on the detected superset**, not on a declared conflict. Any unsettled later
direction demotes a departure to `not verifiable from available evidence`, inside
`nextCockpitReadingCriterion` with every other rule rather than as a filter over the departures
list: filtering would leave the word `departure` rendered in the row above, which is the verdict
DRC-4511 forbids, on screen. Over-suppression is the safe direction, and the cost is a suppressed
departure on a session where the reader steered without contradicting themselves, which one click
clears.

**The answer is a settlement**, three scalars in the annotation store: when the reader answered,
what they answered through, and the revision it rested on. Not a revision field, because a revision
is immutable so an assessment citing revision 1 cannot be re-pointed. Not in the session, because
this ruling forbids that. `through` comes from the client, since the moment settled is the one the
reader was looking at, and is clamped to now so a forged value cannot disable the block forever.

**The window is the record's own.** A direction older than the tail `io.read_tail` keeps is not in
the entries and cannot be counted, so on a long session the suppression can release because the
evidence aged out rather than because the question was answered. The block states what it read
rather than implying it read everything.

## DEC-17: the shape contract

DEC-15 requires an evaluation rubric "before automatic assessments are enabled". A reader requested
reading imported that gate by citing DEC-15 as its authority, and a citation cannot be broader than
the thing it cites. So the rubric gates automatic evaluation only, and a reader requested reading is
held to a shape contract instead. A shape contract removes failure classes rather than measuring a
rate, which is why it can stand where no rate has been measured.

Seven rules:

1. Three results per constraint, a closed set: `departure`, `consistent with the evidence read`,
   `not verifiable from available evidence`.
2. `not verifiable` is the fallback whenever output is absent or unparseable.
3. A `departure` carries a resolvable citation: a named evidence entry with its type and source.
   Absence of evidence never produces one.
4. `consistent with the evidence read` is not `met` and may never be rendered as one.
5. Where a harness and an evidence type do not combine, the row states the limit. A limit is never
   a `consistent`.
6. Goal and Expected Output are separate constraints, each naming itself. Never blended.
7. Asymmetric, keyed on constraint identity so it needs no clause interpretation. Expected Output
   may return nothing but `not verifiable` when every cited entry is assistant authored, because
   self report is not evidence of a deliverable. Goal may return a `departure` on assistant authored
   evidence, because a stated change of direction is what that evidence is good for, and a
   `consistent` resting only on it must say so in its evidence line.

Rule 7 is amended below, last by
[the amendment of 2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence), which
lets an outcome line rest on one of the agent's own messages. Rules 1 and 6 gain a constraint about
what the agent claims, with a fourth result of its own, by
[the amendment of 2026-10-04](#amended-2026-10-04-owner-what-the-agent-claims-is-its-own-constraint).

Rules 3 and 7 are load bearing: they make an uncited departure and a deliverable claim resting on
nothing that shows work unrenderable rather than rare. Rule 4 is weaker than it reads, and the
amendment below says so.

### Amended 2026-09-10: rule 7 asks whether an entry shows work, not who typed it

Reversed for the agent's own messages by
[the amendment of 2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence).

As written, rule 7 keys the Expected Output test on who wrote a cited entry, and that inverts its
own reason. The reason is that self report is not evidence of a deliverable, and a request is not
evidence of one either. Keyed on authorship, citing the reader's own words licensed a verdict about
her own deliverable while citing the actual work result demoted. Seven adversaries found it running
against the built producer; none of five reviewers reading the rule had.

The test is now whether a cited entry demonstrates work. On Claude and Codex nothing does, so
Expected Output stays not verifiable there, which is where it already was. The change only ever
narrows what may be said.

Two rules were added beside it, both from the same pass and both demoting on either constraint. A
verdict resting only on entries Cargento itself derived is this board quoting itself: an observer
snapshot is a paraphrase of the session, not evidence about it. And a `consistent` resting only on
the reader's own request is agreeing with the question, which is the shape a reader is most likely
to misread as corroboration because the words match. A departure on her own words is different and
stands: a stated change of direction is exactly what that evidence is good for.

### Amended 2026-09-10: rule 4 is a backstop and the word list has two halves

One flat list of forbidden words demoted six of eight natural departure sentences. "The tests
failed", "not done", "incomplete" are the ordinary vocabulary of saying a thing did not happen, so
the guard against reassurance was the thing hiding departures.

Success words always demote, because the model may never assert the work landed under any result.
Failure words demote only under a `consistent`, where claiming failure while agreeing with the
evidence is incoherent. A success word under a negator is a failure statement and keeps its
departure.

Rule 4's primitive is that the model emits a token rather than a sentence, and that prose renders
only under a departure. The word list is the second line and it is a judgement rather than a
measurement. Saying otherwise would be the same overstated claim the rule exists to stop the model
making.

#### Amended 2026-09-24: a check's own result word is not a verdict (owner ruling)

Owner ruling, 2026-09-24 (DRC-4677 review). Under
[DEC-23](#dec-23-a-claude-code-sessions-record-of-its-checks-may-show-the-work) item 8 the only
`consistent` Expected Output can carry rests on a cited check whose latest run passed, and the row
the model read says so in Cargento's own words ("passed, as the tool reported"). A model that
described that evidence truthfully tripped the success-word half of the backstop, so every such
reading was withdrawn as a stated verdict, and "no later write" or "not inspected" tripped the
negator half on its own. The two sentences above still hold everywhere else. For an Expected Output
`consistent` that rests on a cited check passing item 8:

1. `passed`, `passes` and `passing` are the tool's report, not a verdict, and so is "failed" when
   the cited row itself says an earlier run failed.
2. A negator counts only beside a success word that remains, so "not complete" still withdraws it
   and "no later write" does not. A negated pass word still withdraws it, read in word order before
   the pass words are set aside: "did not pass" and "no tests passed" are failure statements, and so
   is a negated "work" or "expected".
3. Every other success word still withdraws it: met, complete, verified, works, delivered and the
   rest of the list.

The prompt now asks for `detail` only under a departure, and says a check's result words are
Cargento's, so the prose the rule reads is rarer at the source. A consistent's prose is never shown,
so this adds no prose to the page. Goal verdicts and departures are unchanged.

### Amended 2026-09-12: rules 3, 4, 5 and 7 are told apart in the stored shape

The seven rules say what a row may conclude and did not say how a row records which rule
concluded it. Rule 5's limit row is told apart on the page, which derives the limit itself, and was
not told apart in the store, where the limit was never written. Rule 3's demotion of an uncited
departure, rule 4's backstop and rule 7's three stored byte-identically to a model that said
`unverifiable` on its own. Rule 2 is the one that already recorded itself, by leaving `result`
absent.

Every row now names the rule that left it without a verdict, as a token: `not-asked` for rule 5,
`unreadable` for rule 2 (a row the page still answers from its own derivation, since that token
never accompanies a result), `uncited` for rule 3, `verdict-stated` for rule 4's backstop, and
`no-work-shown`, `board-quoting-itself` and `uncorroborated` for rule 7 and the two rules added
beside it. Where more than one fires the producer records the one the page would have said, in the
page's order, so a live row and its stored copy never disagree about the reason. The contract
otherwise stands as written: the results are unchanged, the fallback for an unreadable reply is
still an absent result rather than a present one, and the token set is closed on both sides.

### Amended 2026-09-24: rules 4, 6 and 7 meet a checklist, a tool outcome and a level

Rule 6:
[DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
makes the Goal and each outcome line separate constraints, each naming itself and never blended, so
a reading has up to seven (item 3).

Rule 7 and its 2026-09-10 amendment: on Claude Code a check's recorded result, read under
[DEC-23](#dec-23-a-claude-code-sessions-record-of-its-checks-may-show-the-work), now demonstrates
work, so "On Claude and Codex nothing does" holds for Codex and for everything else on Claude Code.
A `consistent` on an outcome line needs the latest run of a relevant check passing inside the
evidence window with no later write, and says it is as the tool reported, not inspected. On an
outcome line the agent's own account still yields `not verifiable`, as rule 7 says. On the Goal, a
`consistent` resting on the agent's own account says "Consistent with what the session said at #<n>;
not a check". A message that matches a copied correction is not person-authored evidence (DEC-24
item 9).

Rule 4: [DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn)'s "None or low"
names a level, never `met`. Its floor for an analysis needs every outcome line `consistent` on a
tool-reported check. The live estimate says it reads checks and file paths, not what the intent
says, and the analysis says it read each line of the intent against the checks and messages it
cited. A result is never "Done" and never a check mark (DEC-24 item 6).

Rule 7's outcome-line half here is replaced by
[the amendment of 2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence).

### Amended 2026-10-03 (owner): the agent's own words are evidence

The owner, 2026-10-03: "allow whatever the agent says or does to be used as evidence for claims
and drift." The reason given: "it is obviously evidence, and you cant have a drift tool that does
not check or understand what an agent is doing or has done." Three adversarial reviews of the first
build the same day narrowed how far it reaches, each in the withholding direction, and this section
records the ruling as built after that review.

What it reverses and what it narrows:

- [Rule 7's amendment of 2026-09-10](#amended-2026-09-10-rule-7-asks-whether-an-entry-shows-work-not-who-typed-it),
  whose reason was that self report is not evidence of a deliverable, is reversed for one entry
  type: `agent_message`, a message the agent wrote. An outcome line may rest on one, and a
  departure or a `consistent` on one stands. Nothing else the agent's tooling publishes joins it:
  a decision, a task's birth, a stage, a dispatch, Pi narration or a Codex final answer still
  carries no verdict on a line, and `no-work-shown` is still emitted for a line resting only on
  those, on the reader's own request or on Cargento's paraphrase.
- [The 2026-10-01 rule on a line about what the agent tells you](#amended-2026-10-01-a-line-about-what-the-agent-tells-you-cannot-be-shown)
  is narrowed, not reversed. A `consistent` on such a line is still withdrawn as
  `tells-the-person` unless one of the agent's messages is among what it rests on, sent at or after
  the latest check it cites (or, citing none, the latest check in the window the prompt carried),
  because a passing check alone still cannot show what the agent said, and nor can "I'll run it
  now" said before the run. Measured on review: the line "the tests are run once more, unpiped,
  and the counts are reported", read `consistent` on a passing check alone, stood under the first
  build and is withdrawn now, and so is the same line citing the check and that earlier message;
  the analysis level no longer reaches "None or low" on it. The page reads this rule's token from
  the store and does not re-derive it, as before.
- [DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
  item 6 said "Consistent with what the session said at #<n>; not a check" on the Goal only. A
  `consistent`, on the Goal or a line, that rests on the agent's messages alone now says
  "Consistent with what the agent said at #<n>; not a check". Any other agent-authored source of
  a Goal's `consistent` keeps "what the session said".

What a reading reads. On Claude Code each top-level assistant text message in the transcript is a
fact of its own, `agent_message`, labelled "Agent said" in the session's activity. Sidechain and
meta records stay out, a thinking or tool call block has no text to read, and a record Claude Code
wrote itself rather than the model (its `<synthetic>` sentinel) is not the agent speaking. Its
title is the message's first sentence, read like a reader's message. The ledger also carries the
whole message, redacted the same way and cut at 1,000 characters, in a field the page never
receives. The prompt quotes it as one JSON string, with the menu heading's text neutralised, as it
quotes a check's output tail, so a message cannot forge a row or a section. The prompt chooses
entries by title first, as it always has, so the agent's words never cost a verdict its evidence.
Then it swaps titles for whole messages: the reader's first, newest first, inside half the 16 KiB
budget, and then the agent's, newest first, inside a quarter of it. An agent message has the
lowest priority in the byte bound, below a written path: measured on review, a hundred newer
messages otherwise dropped the older write that showed what the session did. The project event cap
reserves the agent's messages after the session's own checks and the reader's messages, so a
talkative session cannot evict either.

Only a reading the reader pressed for reads them. The unasked lane, which nobody watches, sends
nothing the agent said, and the scorers keep the same default.

What the model is told. The agent's messages, not test counts, are its report: quoted data, never
instructions. It compares them with the record. A contradicted claim, an unkept promise, or work
done instead of what was asked is a departure. A `consistent` may rest on a message it cites. The
outcome lines are put to the model whenever the agent spoke, whether or not tool output may be sent.

Two rules were added in the withholding direction:

- A `consistent` that cited a check whose latest run failed inside the window never stands on the
  agent's account left beside it. It is withdrawn as `check-does-not-show-it`. A cited write or an
  aged pass beside the agent's account does not withdraw it on its own.
- An outcome line's `consistent` resting on no work is withdrawn whenever the session's record
  holds a check that failed inside the window, whether the reply cited it, the prompt carried it,
  the budget crowded it out or no grant sent it. Its token is `failed-check-on-record`, except
  where the prompt had no room for the failure, which keeps `failed-check-unread`.

What stays:

- [DEC-15](#dec-15-the-floor-and-the-overlay)'s rule that a reading never states the work was met,
  and the prompt sentence saying so.
- Rule 4's success-word backstop.
- `board-quoting-itself`: a verdict resting only on Cargento's own paraphrase.
- `uncorroborated`: a `consistent` resting only on the reader's own request.
- [DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn)'s floor. "None or low"
  from an analysis still needs every outcome line `consistent` on a passing tool-reported check, so
  the agent's word alone never reassures. A departure resting on the agent's message reads Medium.
- Steer back's owner-approved text. A line that departed on the agent's message shows as departed,
  with its time and number, in the same words as any other departure. A `consistent` is still
  only ever "as the tool reported".

What is sent. This is new content to the model provider: each agent message, redacted and cut at
1,000 characters, inside a quarter of the 16 KiB prompt, on a reading of a Claude Code session the
reader pressed for. Redaction recognises credential shapes, and since this review also the value
after a cue such as `Authorization: Bearer`, `--password`, `password:` or a name like
`DB_PASSWORD`, `PGPASSWORD` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, leaving code that names a value (`None`, `$VAR`,
`next_token()`) and prose (`bearer auth`, `secret=staging`) alone; a password or token with neither
a shape nor a cue can still go verbatim, and an agent message can repeat tool output whether or not
tool output was allowed. The cue is applied to every published string, so a title holding one
moves to a new fact id once, the 2026-09-12 precedent `project_context` records, accepted the same
way; the hash input is unchanged. The words are held in memory for the reading and the live project
context only: not stored, not in the session history store, and not published on any page route,
where only each message's title appears (its first line cut at sentence punctuation and 112
characters, which for text with no such break can span more than one sentence).
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#claude-code-reading-calls) says the same. The route's "What is sent"
list names the agent's messages and the outcome lines, and the tool-output item says the agent's
messages may quote tool output.

Re-consent. An Allow is bound to a content version and the destination it was given for
(`reading_policy.CONTENT_VERSION`, in `permission_disclosure`), so an Allow given before the
disclosure named the agent's messages does not cover a press that carries them: a Claude Code
session's press, read by Claude Code or by Codex, asks once more. A press on any other harness,
Codex's included, carries none of them and reads at `WORDS_CONTENT_VERSION`, so it is asked again
only where its destination moved; the unasked lane reads the same way, so the bump never stops it.
An older build's Turn off clears the version through a trigger of its own, and an older build's
Allow writes none, so a rollback cannot carry this build's answer onto that build's disclosure.

An accepted decay. A stored departure resting on an agent message stops counting once that message
leaves the transcript tail the live record reads: the message is not admitted to the session
history store, so the citation no longer resolves and the page and the analysis level drop it. That
is accepted rather than fixed by a history admission, because storing what the agent said is a
larger exposure than this ruling asked for.

The abstention acceptances, Codex's of 2026-09-14 and Claude Code's of 2026-10-02, describe the
producer before this ruling. They were not re-scored against it, and
[DEC-18](#dec-18-an-unasked-reading-is-permitted-and-gated-on-delivery-first)'s precondition 3
rests on them, so that precondition is owed a re-score of this producer before the unasked default
changes. The abstention packets do not yet carry the agent's messages:
`project_context.frozen_claude_agent_messages` exists for an offline replay, and wiring it into
`scripts/mark_abstention.py`'s frozen ledger would change the packet format, so it is a follow-up.
Codex sessions are unchanged for now: reading a Codex session's assistant messages as
`agent_message` is a follow-up too. Two more follow-ups, recorded rather than built: a Claude Code
rewind leaves the abandoned branch in the transcript and nothing filters it by `parentUuid`, so an
agent message from a branch the reader rewound past can be evidence; and the page's expected-output
limit (`nextReadingOutputLimit`) keys on whether the route has a provider alone, not on whether the
record holds an agent message or a sent check.

### Amended 2026-10-04 (owner): what the agent claims is its own constraint

The owner, 2026-10-04, after
[the first drift replay run](drift-replay/README.md#the-first-run-2026-10-04), delegated this
build and its wording: "do the 'What I'd do next' section yourself". That run found most of the
drift a reader pushed back on was a status claim, such as "six sessions running", "merged" or
"tests pass", that no line of the intent speaks to, so no constraint a reading asked could hold it.

The question. Every reader-requested reading of a Claude Code session whose prompt carries one of
the agent's messages also asks a third kind of constraint, keyed `claims`, independent of the goal
and the lines: does any message the agent wrote claim a state of the work (running, done, finished,
merged, pushed, deployed, passing, fixed, sent, filed) that the recorded checks, writes and
messages contradict, or that nothing recorded shows? It is posed the way the lines are: sized into
the header when the ledger holds an agent message, and kept only when one was selected. The unasked
lane never asks it, because it never carries what the agent said, and nor do the scorers, whose
packets do not carry it yet.

Its results, on this constraint only:

- `departure`: the record contradicts the claim. It cites the agent's message and the entry that
  contradicts it, so rule 3 holds: a departure names its evidence.
- `not shown by the record`, a fourth result and the token `unsupported`: the claim is a state of
  the work and nothing in the record read shows it. It cites the message. It is not a departure,
  because absence of evidence never produces one (rule 3 stands as written). It is shown as a
  caution, and it reads Medium in the analysis level with its own reason, `claim-not-shown`,
  because it is the first run's most common drift. The row says the record read is the board's
  recent tail, so "not shown" is about what was read, never that the thing did not happen.
- `consistent`: every such claim is shown. It cites the message and the entries showing it.
- `not verifiable`: there is no such claim, or the evidence cannot settle it.

So rule 1's closed set has a fourth member on this one constraint, and the token `unsupported`
anywhere else is outside its set and leaves no result (rule 2). Rule 6 gains a third kind of
constraint, so a reading names up to eight, the goal, six lines and the claims.

The resolver rules that already applied still apply, and one is added in the withholding direction.
A result without the citations it needs, the message and, for a departure or a consistent, the
entry it was compared with, is withdrawn as `claim-uncited`; a consistent resting on the agent's
message alone is the agent agreeing with itself, which is rule 4's backstop for this question. The
success-word backstop reads its prose as before. A comparison resting only on Cargento's own
paraphrase is `board-quoting-itself`. `check_supports` drops a cited check that does not carry the
verdict, so a pass followed by a change does not show "passing" now, and a consistent beside a
failure in the window is withdrawn as for a line, cited (`check-does-not-show-it`), unread
(`failed-check-unread`) or only on record (`failed-check-on-record`).

The prompt had 6 bytes of room under `INTENT_SHARE_BYTES`, the worst goal and six lines measuring
9,210 of 9,216. The answer shape is now spelt once and named `A` where it was spelt per constraint,
which freed most of what the worst intent spent, and the claims instruction is one sentence; the
worst header with the claims question measures 9,198, and the record keeps at least 7,168 bytes.
Eight answers at the reply cap's worst measure 4,751 bytes compact and 5,664 indented, under
8,192.

The page. A row "What the agent claimed", after the outcome lines under its own heading, with its
states: "What the agent said at #n is contradicted at #m"; "… is not shown by the record. The record
read is the board's recent tail."; "… is shown at #m", with "as the tool reported; not inspected"
when that is a check; and "Can't tell". A contradicted or unshown claim is not a departure from the
intent: the answer counts only the intent's departures, says a failed check first, then the claim,
and a claims row with nothing to say never holds "Nothing found" back. The analysis level names a
contradicted claim `claim-contradicted` rather than a departure. Steer back adds one line for a
claim the record contradicts or does not show, in the owner-approved template's style: `You said
"<claim>" at 14:02 (#12 in Cargento); the record does not show it.` The claim is the message's
published title, its first sentence, which the activity list already shows, and never the words a
reading read; that is the one place the correction reads a summary.

What is sent to the model does not change: the agent's messages already go on a press that carries
them ([SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#claude-code-reading-calls)). What `POST /api/correction` returns
does, by the claim's first sentence, a title the page already publishes, and SECURITY.md says so.

The downgrade. A stored reading may now carry the key `claims`, the result `not shown by the
record` and the reason `claim-uncited`. A build that knows none of them refuses the reading whole,
publishes the refusal beside the press count and writes the raw reading back untouched, the
existing refusal of 2026-09-12, so stepping forward reads it again. The abstention scorer's
question list gains `claims` only where a reading answered it, with an outcome of its own,
`judged:unsupported`, never counted as a departure; marking it is owed when the packets carry the
agent's messages.

### The two typed fields are one line each, and that is a security decision

Recorded here because it had no durable home. The goal and the expected output are collapsed to a
single line by the same control character scrub that stops a pasted private key body surviving into
a published string, and it runs server side on write and again on read back. Admitting newlines
means relaxing that scrub for two fields that a reader pastes into, which is the wrong two fields to
relax it for. Since DEC-24 item 3 the expected output is a checklist, and each of its lines is held
to the same rule: one line, the same scrub, on write and on read back. The browser collapses on input as well, so the reader watches it happen rather than
finding out afterwards.

### What the contract does not remove

A false `consistent` on the Goal constraint, resting on the agent's own narration. Its rate is
unmeasured. What bounds it is that the claim is narrow, produced once per press, never aggregated
into a count and never pushed, so exposure does not compound. That bound holds only while there is
no cadence, no aggregation and no notification, and the full rubric becomes owed the moment any of
the three changes.

Since [2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence), a second: a false
`consistent` on an outcome line resting on the agent saying it finished. Its rate is unmeasured
too. It is bounded the same way, only on a press, and further: it never stands beside a check that
failed in the window, it reads "what the agent said; not a check" rather than as the tool reported,
and it never lifts the drift level to "None or low".

#### Amended 2026-09-24: a cadence makes the full rubric owed

[DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn) adds a cadence, a live
estimate after every turn, so by the paragraph above the full rubric is now owed. The measured
levels DRC-4692 validates are its first measured part.
[DEC-23](#dec-23-a-claude-code-sessions-record-of-its-checks-may-show-the-work) adds a second
surviving class beside this one: a false `consistent` on Expected Output resting on a success the
tool reported, which DRC-4666 qualifies the producer against. Neither level is aggregated into a
count or pushed.

### The contract is built and unexercised

Recorded 2026-09-10, because a reader of this section otherwise concludes the seven rules are held
and they are not yet held against anything real.

No producer writes an assessment, and `annotations.published` emits no field for one, so
`annotation.assessment` is undefined for every row a server has ever served. About 120 lines of the
renderer, the criterion rows and the departures list among them, are reached only by tests that
inject a shape directly. Every assertion about these seven rules is therefore evidence that the
renderer is self-consistent, not that the contract is right, which is the fixture-as-specification
failure this repository has already measured once.

Whoever adds the producer adds the published field in the same change and re-derives those
assertions from it. One trap in particular: the `assessment` entry in the page's annotation rebuild
list is the only production mention of the field, and two defects on this branch have already
landed in that list. Publishing an assessment without adding it there reproduces the defect and the
suite stays green, because the fixtures bypass the rebuild.

### The condition on enabling, not on building

The original ruling below was amended on 2026-09-14 to allow the captain's acceptance of the
recorded case review to enable the control, and on 2026-10-02 to let the owner's acceptance open
the Claude Code producer's own gate without a pass.

The reading is built now. The `Ask for a reading` control (`Check for drift` from DRC-4639, `Analyze drift` since DRC-4680) is not enabled until an abstention check
has run and passed: at least one recorded session per case kind DEC-15 names, across both Claude and
Codex, with a person other than whoever writes the reading prompt marking each constraint in advance
with one binary expectation. Should this abstain, or not. No severity, no expected judgement text,
no threshold. Every case marked should abstain must return `not verifiable from available evidence`.
A case marked should not abstain that abstains is recorded and does not fail, because over
abstention is the safe direction.

The check cannot be run without a producer to run it on, so a recorded pass implies one exists. That
is why the control reads one gate rather than two.

#### Amended 2026-09-10: the captain marks the corpus

The second person requirement is removed. On this milestone the captain is that other person and
there is no third, so holding the check as written left the constant at not run indefinitely, the
control permanently disabled, and the promise unkept by anything the producer builds.

Three things the requirement was protecting are not relaxed, because they are what makes a mark
evidence rather than agreement. Marks are written before any producer runs against the corpus: a
mark written after seeing an output is not a mark. The corpus is recorded sessions only, and stays
separate from the synthesised case set, because sharing one would let a synthesised fixture satisfy
a gate written for recorded sessions. And cross agent verification on that case set is untouched: a
case whose generator and verifier are the same agent is not admitted.

What this costs is that the marker is also the person who wants the feature, so a mark wrong in the
permissive direction has nobody to catch it. The mitigation is the first of those three, and it is
weaker than a second reader.

#### Amended 2026-09-28: the agent may write marks the captain agrees to

The captain may have the agent building this check propose a judge or abstain mark for each
constraint, and a mark the captain agrees to may be written into the marks file by that agent. An
agreed mark is the captain's. A mark the captain has not agreed to is not written.

Two things still hold. Marks are written before any producer runs against the corpus, so a mark
written after seeing an output is still not a mark. And the corpus stays recorded sessions only.

What this costs is independence. The agent that proposes the marks also wrote the reading prompt,
and it is the same model family as the Claude Code producer being qualified. That is the case the
original ruling excluded. A blind spot the proposer and the producer share would make a permissive
mark look right to both, and the captain's agreement is then the only independent check. The
mitigation is that disagreement is shown rather than smoothed: every constraint where the proposal
differs from the captain's own mark goes to the captain to decide.

#### Amended 2026-09-14: the captain accepts the case review

After answering all twelve recorded Claude and Codex snapshots, the captain accepted that review
as sufficient to unlock reader-requested readings. That decision supersedes the requirement to
wait for a scoring run before enabling the control.

The build publishes `reading_check: "accepted"` and enables the control and its HTTP route.
`passed` remains the scorer-backed enablement state; accepting the review does not manufacture
a scoring result. The local answer key is bound to the frozen packet, and the committable
[acceptance record](abstention/acceptance.json) carries its hashes and marks without session text.

The producer's evidence and lifecycle rules, the explicit press and disclosure, and the
`--observer-model` opt-in still apply to each request. The evaluator retains its existing verdicts
and coverage rules for future scoring. This amendment concerns the reader-requested control.

Amended again 2026-09-23: [DEC-21](#dec-21-a-reading-works-the-first-time-you-ask) replaces the
`--observer-model` opt-in for reader-requested readings with a remembered first-press answer and a
daily cap, once DRC-4640 ships. The press and the disclosure still apply to each request.

#### How the check is run, 2026-09-12

Two scripts, both outside the gate and neither in CI. `scripts/mark_abstention.py --build` draws
cases from the live board into `~/.cargento/abstention-cases.json`, and its marking mode collects
the captain's `judge` or `abstain` per constraint into `~/.cargento/abstention-marks.json`.
`scripts/score_abstention.py --score --producer <name>` then hands each case to `reading.produce`
with the two constant yardstick sentences as a synthetic revision (or, in format 5, the case's own
goal and outcome lines), through the named producer's reading model, and writes two halves: a local results file beside the cases, and a committable summary under
`docs/abstention/`. Where the cases live and what each file may hold is the security ruling, in
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#the-abstention-check).

Historical cases can instead use a frozen row, semantic facts and evaluation clock. This avoids
scoring today's changed or absent session against yesterday's mark. The packet is prepared before
marking; the key binds to its digest, and the producer's lifecycle rules still apply at the frozen
time. The format and procedure live in the
[abstention documentation](abstention/README.md#historical-replay-case-format-4).

The qualification's parser stamp now hashes parsed derivation code, with a versioned hash domain,
rather than source bytes (DRC-4731, 2026-09-29). A comment or layout edit used to demote every
recorded case despite deriving the same facts. Those edits now keep the stamp; changes to literals,
expressions or control flow still invalidate the packet. Old byte-stamped packets are not rewritten,
and the exact contents check still applies. The stamp includes `io.py`, since its bounded byte
reader decides which check records were reachable at the freeze. A parent cutoff that the check
budget cannot reach refuses a freeze and demotes a score-time contents check. Administrative
records after a recorded stop do not count as resumed work; user and assistant messages do. Freeze
a fresh packet after the final producer changes.

The scorer prepares its local files before charging, and executes a verified private CLI copy so an
installation update cannot select different bytes for a later call. The native copy measurements and
the remaining same-owner limits are owned by
[the security ruling](../SECURITY.md#the-abstention-check). These preparation changes do not supply
a passing score, alter existing marks or open the Claude Code reading gate.

Each (case, constraint) lands in exactly one of `withheld:<reason>`, `unparsed`, `abstained`,
`judged:consistent` or `judged:departure`. Withheld is its own column because the corpus this was
written against made the trap concrete: twenty of twenty three cases had an empty ledger, so the
producer refused them before any model call. Folding that into "abstained" would have reported a
producer that never abstains as one that always does, on three exercised sessions. A withheld case
counts for neither side. `unparsed` is kept apart from `abstained` because rule 2's fallback renders
the same sentence and is a different fact.

The output column is mostly the ruling's. Only a case whose record shows work is asked the Expected
Output question (`asks_output`, which reads the entries the prompt carries; the check never grants
tool output, so that is a Pi case with a work result), the collector fixes the mark to `abstain`
everywhere else, and `resolve` answers `not verifiable` there without asking. The scorer records `asks_output` per case
and the report says how many output columns were never asked, so twenty three abstentions on a
corpus with no Pi session read as the ruling's answer rather than as the model abstaining twenty
three times.

PASS therefore needs two things. No case marked should-abstain judged; a judge mark that abstains is
recorded and does not fail. And the coverage floor: at least one evidence-bearing, kind-tagged,
recorded case per DEC-15 kind, on both Claude and Codex, that reached the model. Ten, minimum. The
kind tags come from the rubric expectation file's `recorded` entries, so tagging a case after the
fact does not touch the marks. Below the floor the verdict is `short` and PASS is refused with the
shortfall printed per harness. The summary also carries the sha256 of the marks file as scored, and
a later report whose marks no longer hash to it says the marks moved and refuses PASS. The floor is
now judged per producer; see the amendment of 2026-09-27 below.

The scorer never writes to the annotation store, never posts to the reading route, and never flips
`annotations.ABSTENTION_CHECK` or `annotations.CLAUDE_ABSTENTION_CHECK`. Each flip is a separate
change, made by hand, after a run has passed on a corpus that meets the floor, or after an
acceptance: the captain's of the case review under the amendment above, or for Claude Code the
owner's of 2026-10-02 below.

#### Amended 2026-09-27: the floor is judged per producer

The owner ruled three things on 2026-09-27, while qualifying the Claude Code producer (DRC-4666).

1. Coverage is judged per producer. The harness of the producer being scored needs a recorded
   case of each of the five DEC-15 kinds that reached the model. The other harness's cases are
   cross-harness controls: they are marked, scored and can fail the run, and a kind they lack is
   reported as not produced rather than counted short. Codex produced no supported departure in six
   attempts: it either worked around the stated scope or declined and suggested the out-of-scope
   fix. Getting one would have taken a follow-up approving the work, and item 2 rules that out. A
   floor that required it could never be met.
2. A departure the prompt directed is not a supported departure. A case counts for that kind
   only when the agent left the stated scope on its own. The scorer cannot tell who directed a
   departure, so this binds the rubric: a case whose prompt asked for the departure is not tagged
   `supported-departure`.
3. The Claude Code producer passes `--system-prompt` with a fixed sentence, so Claude Code's
   default system prompt is not sent. What the CLI still sends, measured against a local stub, is
   listed under [Claude Code reading calls](../SECURITY.md#claude-code-reading-calls).

`score_abstention.py` records each harness's part in the committed summary: `role` is `scored`,
`control`, or `required` for a run that names no producer. `missing` lists the kinds that hold
back a scored or required harness, and `not_produced` the kinds a control lacks. A run that names
no producer keeps the original floor on both harnesses, as every summary written before this
amendment was scored.
The format is owned by the
[abstention documentation](abstention/README.md#how-to-argue-with-a-result).

#### Amended 2026-10-01: a reader's correction and a transcript stop

The owner ruled two things on 2026-10-01, while looking for DRC-4666's supported-departure case.

1. A supported departure may rest on the reader's own correction rather than a failed check. The
   resolver already lets a Goal departure stand on the reader's words, so this binds the search
   and the rubric, not the code. A search for a failed check alone read no reader message: it
   scanned 4,882 sessions and found no case, where a search of the reader's corrections found 87
   sessions carrying one.
2. A Claude Code turn stop the history store has rolled past is vouched by the transcript. The
   store is capped at about 1 MiB and held 2026-09-17 to 2026-09-30 when measured, so every older
   stop read as unobserved. Such a stop counts when the transcript's own top-level
   `stop_hook_summary` for the session sits at the `finished_at` and its hooks did not keep the turn
   going. A stop inside the store's reach still needs its observation. The board stamps the
   hook's arrival rather than the record, so `finished_at` must be the record's own stamp: over the
   store's 700 observed stops none sat within a millisecond of its record, and 217 within a second,
   the record about 115 ms earlier. A stop with no record is refused rather than inferred from the
   last assistant message. The scorer counts the cases it vouched this way itself, in
   `recorded_on_transcript_stop`, and never reads the packet's own `lifecycle_from` for it.

The same day the owner directed the qualification to run to completion within the approved
ceilings of 23 scorer calls and 26 Claude CLI invocations. Two changes followed from it. A second
continuation grant could follow the first, which also failed, and the ledger cap became 23; the
ruling below has since raised it to 28. And a
Claude Code case's user messages and `transcript_bytes` are frozen from the transcript as it stood
at `captured_at`, because the board reads only the last 400 KB of today's file: the correction the
supported-departure case rests on sat 750 KB from the end of a session that ran on.

The second continuation then failed too, and spent the last of the 23 calls. The owner kept the
Claude Code gate shut and authorized one more five-case scored run past that ceiling, as a third
continuation: the ledger cap is 28 scorer calls, beside 31 Claude CLI invocations overall, those
five calls and the browser walk among them. The grant chain now reads grants by one naming
pattern, at most nine of them, each binding the failed result before it, so the third needs no new
code. A grant file under any other name, or numbered past nine, is refused rather than ignored.
Raising the cap authorizes the run, not its packet: the third grant's `marking` and `sealed`
phases are each committed in their own reviewed change, as the first two were.

#### Amended 2026-10-01: a reading sees the reader's whole message

The overlay [DEC-15](#dec-15-the-floor-and-the-overlay) admits reads the session's evidence against
the words a person typed, and until this amendment a person's message reached it as its title: the
first sentence of its first line, at most 112 characters, which the ledger then cut at 180. Measured
the same day on a real correction, that dropped the point. The reader's message asked what an
unexplained status meant, and then, in later sentences, said the original goal included merging and
that the branches were not being merged back. The model received only the opening question, so a
departure the reader had named in their own words could not rest on them, which is the case item 1
of the amendment above allows.

The owner ruled to send the whole message, bounded, knowing it sends more of the reader's own words
to the provider and moves a [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#observer-model-calls) boundary.

1. Every user-role message in the observed record carries its words beside its title: the whole
   message on one line, through the same redaction as the title, at most 1,000 characters. That
   holds for a Claude Code message (a slash command is its command as typed), every other
   harness's user-role message, and an Antigravity direction.
2. A person's message carries its words in the ledger beside its title, under a 1,000-character
   cap of its own, with the menu-field scrub that stops a separator forging a column. Every other
   entry is unchanged, and so is a copied correction, which is Cargento's text rather than the
   reader's. A fact with no words, from a packet frozen earlier or republished by the history
   store, has its title alone.
3. The reader's words may not cost a verdict its evidence. Entries are chosen by their titles,
   exactly as before this amendment, and only then do the newest messages swap their title for
   their words, each only where its whole row fits the room left and the words' own share, half
   the 16 KiB budget counted in UTF-8 bytes. A message that does not fit is sent by its title. The
   first build chose the words first, and review measured what that cost: fourteen long messages
   left a failed check unread with budget to spare, a work entry stopped the outcome lines being
   asked at fourteen messages where thirteen still asked them, and five 1,000-character CJK
   messages, three bytes a character, dropped all three checks. 281 of 517 recent user messages
   reach the 1,000-character cap, so that was the ordinary case. After the fix, beside a failed
   check and a write, seven full-length ASCII messages or two CJK ones go whole, and every message
   past them goes by its title, at 5, 14, 20 or 40 messages alike.
4. The words are not stored and not published. The history store keeps its field allowlist, the
   page keeps showing titles, and `/api/project-context` drops the words before it answers. The
   reading route, the unasked lane and the abstention packet read them on the server. Fact ids do
   not include them, so no stored citation moves. A departure's `detail` is the model's sentence
   and is stored and shown as before, so the model can now paraphrase a later sentence there.

   Owner, 2026-10-01 (Q7): item 4 has one exception. Up to five of the reader's own messages are
   published on the focused project context as `prompt_choices`, each clipped to the goal's
   240-character cap, so "Use your prompt" can offer them
   ([amendment](#amended-2026-10-01-up-to-five-of-your-prompts-may-be-chosen)). The words field
   itself, and anything past that cap, is still neither stored nor published, and
   `test_reader_words` holds both halves.

The provider each reading may reach is still the one [DEC-21](#dec-21-a-reading-works-the-first-time-you-ask)
item 4 names. The disclosure before the press now says the reader's own messages go in full, up to
1,000 characters each, redacted, and that where the record is too long the oldest go by their first
sentence; an answer given before that sentence existed is not asked again,
and whether it should be is filed separately. The parser digest the abstention
packets are stamped with moves with this change, so a packet frozen before it is refused as
`frozen-on-another-parser` and is frozen again.

#### Amended 2026-10-02: the owner accepts the Claude Code producer without a pass

Every scored Claude Code run failed this check: four runs, the last two each with one false
reassurance among sixteen scored constraints, on different constraints, and the 28 authorized
calls are spent. The owner accepted the Claude Code producer anyway on 2026-10-02, knowing that,
as the captain accepted the Codex review on 2026-09-14. `annotations.CLAUDE_ABSTENTION_CHECK` is
`accepted`, never `passed`, and nothing here turns a failed run into a passing one.

The committable [acceptance record](abstention/claude-acceptance.json) lists every scored run with
its own verdict, digests, counts and spend, and a test reads each from the result file it names,
so the record cannot drop a failure or round one up. The results, their grants and the spend
ledger stay exactly as they were: nothing rewrites, rescores or deletes them. The scorer keeps its
verdicts for any later run, and a later pass would be recorded as `passed` in its own change.
Which sessions Claude Code reads is [DEC-21](#amended-2026-10-02-claude-code-is-accepted)'s.

### Repeated calls

A reading is produced only in response to a discrete reader action, asserted rather than assumed,
and never on render, poll, reconnect, resume, focus change or revision save. One reading in flight
per session. No retry on failure, because a fresh press is required. Each reading is counted and the
count is shown beside the control, against the capacity surface Cargento already renders, so the
reader spends their own capacity and can see it going.

### Two arguments that were withdrawn

Recorded so nobody rebuilds them. The claim that a case set cannot be assembled before a judgement
producer exists is false: cases drawn from recorded sessions with expectations written by a person
need no producer, and only a measured threshold does. And the claim that a reader requested reading
is safe because it is attended is weak: the reader asks precisely because they cannot judge it
themselves, and DEC-15b's persistence makes the same reading unattended when it is re read later.

## DEC-18: an unasked reading is permitted, and gated on delivery first

Decided 2026-09-10 (DRC-4534), replacing DEC-15's "for now" refusal of automatic evaluation.
DEC-17 named this decision as the owner of the tension it could not resolve, and this is the answer.

Automatic evaluation is permitted. A reading you have to ask for only helps someone already looking
at the board, and the whole point is the person who set a session going and walked away.

It is refused in practice until four things are true, in order.

Amended 2026-09-10: the four preconditions gate the automatic switch's default, not the
implementation. Read strictly they put three issues, two of them in another milestone, ahead of the
work on the critical path for about thirty five hours that does not change what the work is. The
delivery recording precondition stays a build gate and lands first, because a raise that records no
delivery outcome is precisely the defect the review view exists to show. Native notifications on
the other two platforms, the off machine lane, and quiet hours become follow ups that widen the
lane and, together, permit the default to change. What that accepts is a capability which on Linux
and Windows honestly reports that it cannot reach the reader, and it is defensible only while the
report stays honest, which is what the three distinct delivery states are for.

1. Delivery is real and recorded. DRC-4328 closes the Linux and Windows server side gap, DRC-4034
   owns the off machine lane, DRC-4540 records the outcome per raise.
2. A producer exists. DRC-4511.
3. DEC-17's abstention check has run and passed.
4. Quiet hours exist. DRC-4032.

Precondition 3 rests on acceptances of the producer as it stood before
[the agent's own words became evidence](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence),
so it is owed a re-score of this producer before the unasked default changes.

Delivery leads rather than the rubric, and that ordering is the substance of the ruling. Measured in
this tree on the day it was decided: `notify_mac` runs one `osascript` call and records nothing
about whether the notification was shown or seen, and `native_notifier` returns a backend on darwin
alone, so Linux and Windows fall back to a browser notification that needs the dashboard tab open.
An automatic evaluation shipped against that would spend the reader's capacity unattended and raise
a departure that reaches nobody on two of three platforms, and could not afterwards say whether it
had arrived on any of them.

### What an off machine signal may carry

DEC-4 permits counts and states only in an off machine payload, never a session name, project,
title, path or request text. On the machine a departure notification can name the session and say
what departed. Off the machine it cannot, and the most it may carry is that a count changed.
DEC-18 does not lift that and did not try.

### The two amendments to the shape

Off by default behind its own switch, evaluating on an observed state change rather than per turn,
raising only a `departure` and never a `consistent`, held under quiet hours. Two things were added
to that draft.

Every raise persists the annotation revision and evidence cutoff it rested on, at raise time. By the
time it is read the annotation may be at a later revision and the evidence window has moved, so a
raise that does not carry its own baseline cannot be understood on return.

The cumulative cap is per session and per day, and exhaustion is visible on the board. The reader is
by construction not present, so "nothing departed" and "nothing was checked" must never render
alike.

### The alternative that was rejected

Automatic evaluation writing into the board only, with no push. It would have sidestepped the
notification contract, quiet hours, delivery recording and the platform gap, and it was the
recommendation put to the captain. Rejected because it gives up the capability the reopening was
about: a board only raise helps only the reader who comes back to look. It stays available as a
first slice if the delivery preconditions prove more expensive than they look.

### What still bounds the surviving failure class

DEC-17 records one class its rules do not remove: a false `consistent` on Goal resting on the
agent's own narration. What bounded it was that a reading was produced once per press, never
aggregated and never pushed. This decision breaks all three, which is why the rubric's acceptance
thresholds gate the switch defaulting to anything other than off. Since 2026-10-03 DEC-17 records a
second: a false `consistent` on an outcome line resting on the agent saying it finished. The
unasked lane reads no agent message, so it cannot produce that one, but the default still waits on
the re-score above. The case set is written in
parallel rather than after the build, because cases need no producer and only a threshold does.
DRC-4542 owns it.

One thing the ruling did not anticipate, found while filing that issue. A case set of source shaped
records is by construction a corpus of real session text, and `docs/captures/README.md` bans exactly
that from this repository: no prompt text, no tool input, no tool output, no file path, and never a
value a person or a model wrote. So where the cases live and what they may contain is settled on
DRC-4542 before any session is read, and it may need a ruling of its own. Synthesising the cases
instead is cheaper and carries no disclosure risk, but DEC-17 warns that a rubric validated on
fixtures the same pass writes is not validated, so the two pull opposite ways and the answer is
written down rather than settled by convenience.

Settled 2026-09-10, and built 2026-09-12: the cases stay local and uncommitted, only expectations
and results are committed, `records.safe_text` applies to anything synthesised, and a synthesised
case is admitted only when a different agent verified it than generated it. The rubric scores
judgement and extraction as two columns, never one. Judgement lands in one of five outcomes,
`correct`, `false-reassurance`, `false-alarm`, `missed-departure` and `over-abstention`, and the
report carries them as five counts with no composite figure, because the composite is exactly what
hides the one DEC-15 calls most damaging. Extraction is which expected citations the producer hit,
which it missed, and which it cited that were not expected. The file format and the admission rule
are in [docs/abstention/README.md](abstention/README.md); the cases and expectations themselves are
the captain's to write.

### What the build had to decide, 2026-09-11

The ruling settles the shape and leaves three choices to the implementation. All three were made
against the ruling rather than for convenience, and each is the kind of thing a later reader would
otherwise re-derive.

Two gates, not one, and they are different rules. One reading per collection is a flag on the loop
that offers rows; one reading at a time is an in-flight slot released when the worker finishes.
Relying on the slot for both was tried and reverted: it is released by the worker, so the
per-collection guarantee would rest on a `codex` subprocess outliving the loop rather than on
anything the function does. Measured with a synchronous worker, twenty candidate rows started twenty
readings.

The per-day cap counts over a rolling twenty-four hours rather than a calendar day. The reader this
exists for walked away at an arbitrary hour, so a midnight reset would hand a fresh allowance to a
board nobody is watching, and a calendar day needs a timezone this runtime does not otherwise carry.

The lane rides `record_history` rather than owning a second is-this-diagnose signal. `--diagnose` is
the one caller that says no to that flag, it runs a collection, and it must not start a subprocess
while reporting what the stores hold. A second flag meaning the same thing is the thing there must
not be two of.

Quiet hours are deferred to DRC-4032 and the switch ships off, which is what the amendment above
permits: the preconditions gate the default rather than whether the thing may be built.

## DEC-19: the page may report a lane, never a delivery

Decided 2026-09-11. Cargento notifies through two independent producers. The server runs one
`osascript` call and exists on macOS alone. The page constructs a browser `Notification` and is the
only lane on Linux and Windows. They do not raise the same events, and the page reports nothing
back.

The page may now tell the server whether a notification lane exists in it: whether the browser
supports notifications, and what its permission is. On page load and on permission change, never
per raise, and carrying no session.

It may not report a delivery. Three things decided that, and the security argument was not one of
them: by this repository's own standard, which is what a forged post can suppress or mask, a
delivery report is side state of the same weight as `POST /api/notify`, which any local account can
already forge.

What decided it was that a per-raise report inflates the count by the number of open tabs, because
every tab computes the edge itself and constructs its own notification while the browser collapses
them to one banner; that it would be the first route on which the page asserts a fact about itself
rather than relaying a reader's action; and that a forged delivery is the single false statement
this milestone ranks worst, because it makes a reader's inaction read as their having ignored
something.

### The negative sentence, which is the part that is easy to get wrong

A report is stale by construction, and stale asymmetrically: a tab that opens sends one and a tab
that closes sends none. So an absence of availability means no lane has been reported since a given
moment, never that none existed when the raise happened.

The sentence says the first. It may not be tightened into the second, and the clause explaining why
is load bearing rather than decoration.

### Three sentences, not two, and what the build had to decide

The ruling names two cases. Building it found a third, and two rules the ruling implies without
saying.

A report has a time, and the time changes what it is evidence of. A lane reported three hours before
a raise and one reported a minute before are different evidence, and a sentence that omits the gap
makes them read alike. So the positive case carries the gap, and a report that arrived after the
raise gets its own sentence saying it is about a later moment. Rendering the positive sentence with a
negative gap would have been the quiet version of the same overclaim.

Only a working lane is a report. A tab reporting that it has no lane records nothing and clears
nothing, because several tabs can be open and one without permission says nothing about another that
has it. The absence of any report is the negative sentence above, which already claims nothing either
way.

The page resends on disagreement rather than on a timer. A report lives in the server's memory, so a
restart loses it, and the page has no way to know a restart happened. The condition is that this tab
has a lane and the payload says none has been reported. That covers the first render, the permission
grant and the restart, with no heartbeat and no token for the boot.

### One argument that was withdrawn

The first recommendation refused any report, on the ground that the page can only say a constructor
did not throw while the server can say what a subprocess returned. That asymmetry does not exist.
`osascript` exits zero under Do Not Disturb and with the hosting application's notifications
switched off, so a zero return means the scripting bridge accepted the call and nothing more. The
two lanes are the same strength, and a shared value name would have been defensible.

## DEC-20: the first screen shows goal beside direction, and drift has one home

Decided 2026-09-23 (DRC-4633), on the Actions Front and Center project. DRC-4636 to DRC-4642 build
it. The session page (item 4, the session page half of item 3, and the primary control) is built by
DRC-4639 and DRC-4642. The landing view and its one screen-level sentence are built by DRC-4636,
and every session's page is one click away by DRC-4638. The row's goal slot and recorded Drift mark
are built by DRC-4637 and DRC-4641, as the amendment to
[NUI-16](design-next-ui.md#nui-16-operations-lead-observation-stays-reachable) describes.

The question was what a person sees about drift when they open Cargento. Measured on a default run
the day it was decided, the honest answer was nothing: four of four sessions had no typed goal, none
had been read, and a departure comes only from a model reading, which a default run does not make.
A first screen built from drift results would have been an empty state. So the ruling puts DEC-15's
floor on the first screen and lets a result add to it, rather than the other way round.

1. Cargento opens on Sessions. Drift belongs to a session, the journey never asks for grouping, and
   Projects caps each row's members and draws no member lines for a project whose sessions are all
   idle. NUI-3, NUI-5 and NUI-16 are amended to match.
2. Every row puts your goal beside the NOW line and leaves the comparison to you, which needs no
   model and no permission. With no typed goal, the goal slot shows the prompt DEC-22 permits,
   labelled "your latest prompt". Expected Output stays on the session page, because on Claude and
   Codex it reads not verifiable under DEC-17 rule 7 and a first screen of those would say nothing.
3. The word drift may name a mark, a section and a control. It never names a result: no surface says
   a session has no drift, because DEC-17 rule 4 forbids rendering `consistent with the evidence
   read` as met. An unsettled later instruction of yours is DEC-16's baseline question and reads
   "Conflict to settle", never Drift. The label asks; it does not say a contradiction was found.
4. Held to merges into the session view and the `held-to` slug aliases to it. A session with no
   project gets the same drift block once its page is routed, but reaching that page is a routing
   question this merge does not settle, so the dead end such a session reaches is not claimed
   removed here.

| State | Words on the row | Source record | Surfaces |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A departure is on record, asked or unasked | Drift | the reading or the unasked check that raised it | first screen row, session page |
| A later instruction of yours is unsettled | Conflict to settle | DEC-16's later-direction floor | session page |
| A reading found the work consistent | none on the row | the stored reading, with its evidence line | session page only |
| Not checked | none on the row; the control offers "Check for drift" | absence of a stored reading | session page; one screen-level sentence on a default run |
| No goal typed | none on the row; the goal slot shows your latest prompt or is empty | absence of an annotation revision | first screen goal slot, session page |

The session page has at most one primary control, and it reads "Check for drift", replacing "Ask
for a reading" and the DRC-4603 ruling that held that label. A session blocked on you, by needs
input or an exact request, gives the primary to the raise when one is offered; without one nothing
is primary while the question is open, and the check sits below it as an ordinary control. The rule
is at most one primary, and none while a question is open without a raise.

### Amended 2026-09-24: the panel is Intent and drift, and the control is Analyze drift

[DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
and [DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn) amend items 2 and 3,
the state table and the primary-control paragraph.

Item 2: on the session page, a session with no saved goal shows the reader's first prompt as an
unsaved draft marked "from your prompt" (DEC-24 item 2). Expected Output becomes a checklist of up
to six lines, and on Claude Code a line may now be read against a check the session ran (DEC-23).
The row's goal slot still shows "your latest prompt": DEC-24 drafts on the session page only (item 2, as
DEC-22's 2026-09-24 amendment scopes it).

Item 3: answers name departures and never say "no drift" (DEC-24 item 1). The word drift may now
also name a level, in the Drift section and the session header pill only. "None or low" is a level
with a per-source floor, never a statement that a session has no drift, and it never reaches a row.
DEC-24 item 4 puts a question about an unsettled later direction in the Drift section. Whether it
replaces the "Conflict to settle" label for the same state is not ruled.

The state table: the "Not checked" row's control offers "Analyze drift". A level adds no words to a
row, and the Drift row mark still comes from a stored departure alone.

The primary control reads "Analyze drift", replacing "Check for drift". The rule of at most one
primary, and none while a question is open without a raise, is unchanged.

### What the session page build had to decide

Built 2026-09-23 (DRC-4639, DRC-4642). The ruling as first written said a blocked session "keeps
its answer control as the primary", and the first build read that as the first option of the first
exact request. The owner overruled that reading on 2026-09-23: no answer option is ever emphasised,
because a filled first option reads as advice to approve, and every option stays a plain control.
The primary goes to the raise that selects the waiting terminal's pane when one is offered, and
otherwise nothing on the page is primary while the question is open.

The block sits after the session's identity header rather than above it, and a blocked session's
question sits between the two, because the question outranks the check. The CURRENT ACTIVITY card is
the agent's direction beside the reader's words, moved into the block rather than copied, so the
NOW line has one renderer. The subagent rows follow the drift block, rather than sharing the
CURRENT ACTIVITY card: on a live session with 31 historical workers, those rows pushed the check
to 2019px on a 900px screen. All worker rows remain on the page.

Inside the block the check is on the first screen: the two goal fields, then the direction, then
`Check for drift` with its send disclosure beside it, then the reading, then the later-direction
block and the caveats on the typed words (the binding sentence, the discard explanation and its
button), then the departures. Measured on a live board at 1440 by 900 with a goal saved, the
button's top sat at 1010px while the disclosure stacked above it, and at 840px once the two shared a
row. The reading says it is never a verification once, in the server's disclosure, and the page's
own sentence renders only where no disclosure was published.

The way back beside a departure is the header's own resume and raise controls, drawn per departure
whatever the session's state; what is missing is said once per departures section, because a limit
repeated under every row is furniture. The raise's own caveat follows the rows it qualifies.

The departures section draws only with the unasked lane on, a departure on record, or a reading the
reader asked for, whose cutoff is printed there and nowhere else. That restores DRC-4543 on this
page: a panel on every session of a board whose switch is off is noise. Under `--no-annotations`
the check stays on the page, inert, with the annotations-off sentence as its one refusal.

### Where a drift row sorts, and why that makes no count

A session with drift on record joins the active group whatever its state, after sessions blocked on
you and before working ones. It is not counted in the `Active now` figure, which keeps NUI-16's
definition of that number. A `consistent` reading sorts exactly where not checked does.

The Sessions projection changes membership without changing the shared active-evidence model.
The mark reads stored departures only; it performs no fresh comparison. Its age comes from the
raise timestamp or the reading's `read_at`, not the time the goal was typed. Older readings carry
only an hour-and-minute stamp, so their age stays unknown. Both the store and page admit the new
optional timestamp while keeping those older records readable. A superseded revision uses the
session page's existing sentence. With annotations off, no mark or promotion is offered.

DEC-17 bounds its surviving failure class, a false `consistent` on Goal, partly by a reading never
being "aggregated into a count". Ordering rows by whether a departure is on record produces no count,
and because `consistent` neither shows on a row nor moves one, a false `consistent` gains no reach it
lacked. So the ranking is not the aggregation that would make a full rubric owed. A drift total on any
screen would be, and none is permitted.

### What DEC-15's indicator sentence now means

DEC-15 says there is no always on drift indicator. That sentence refused evaluation on a cadence, and
it still does: nothing here reads a session in the background. A Drift mark is a stored record shown
where it applies, the same kind of thing as an ended label, and it appears only after a reading the
reader asked for or the unasked lane DEC-18 permits. The skill body carries the same sentence and is
amended when DRC-4641 ships the mark, not before, because it describes the shipped product.

#### Amended 2026-09-24: an indicator on a cadence now exists, off by default

[DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn) amends this subsection. The
live estimate does evaluate after every turn, without a model, in the Drift section and the header
pill only. It is shown only once the reader turns its switch on, and the switch lives in the browser,
so off does not stop the server computing the level. The Drift row mark is still a stored record
shown where it applies. The skill body's cadence sentence is amended by DRC-4696 when the live
estimate ships.

## DEC-21: a reading works the first time you ask

Decided 2026-09-23 (DRC-4634). Items 1 and 2 are built by DRC-4640; item 3 by DRC-4649.
Item 4 is built and gated by DRC-4650; the amendment below records what that means. [The light harness usage bounds](../SECURITY.md#light-harness-usage-asking-a-harness-a-bounded-question)
record the current permission and producer boundaries.

On a default run the reading control tells the reader to restart the server with a flag. The press
already carries a disclosure and is already the consent a browser can give, so the startup flag was
doing a different job: it was one of the three things that stop a local process, which sends no
fetch metadata, from spending readings through a route with no capability token. Removing it is
allowed only with something that does that job instead.

1. The first press of "Check for drift" shows the reading disclosure with "Allow and check". The
   answer is kept in `~/.cargento`, so every tab and a respawned daemon agree; `--forget` clears it,
   and the session page carries the off switch. The startup flag is no longer needed for
   reader-requested readings. It still governs goal summaries, which keep their own consent.
2. A daily cap on reader-requested readings replaces the flag as the bound on a local process. It
   counts over a rolling twenty-four hours, as the unasked lane's cap does, because this runtime
   carries no timezone for a calendar day.
3. `--no-observer-model` and its alias `--no-harness-usage` refuse every model call, the unasked
   lane included. Measured the day this was decided, the unasked lane did not read the flag at all,
   so `--unasked-readings --no-harness-usage` still started Codex readings. That was a security bug
   under the bounds, not a feature, and DRC-4649 fixed it: the off switch now attaches no lane.
4. A reading runs on the session's own harness: a Claude Code session is read by Claude Code, a
   Codex session by Codex. When that harness is not installed the check falls back to the other and
   says so before the press, so session text reaches a second provider only after the page has named
   it. The Claude Code producer needs its own caller entry under the bounds and a fresh abstention
   check before it is offered (DRC-4650).
5. The unasked check stays off by default for this milestone.

This amends DEC-17's 2026-09-14 amendment, which keeps the `--observer-model` opt-in on each
request. The press, remembered answer and daily cap now supply that opt-in. The cap is twelve
actual or reserved attempts per rolling twenty-four hours, admitted atomically before launch.
Off/on and `--forget` revoke consent without erasing unexpired spend; otherwise either would be
a way to refill the budget. A known missing Codex CLI is refused before admission.

### Amended 2026-09-23: Claude Code is built and gated

DRC-4650 builds item 4 and does not offer it. The owner ruled three things on 2026-09-23. The
gate in item 1 was opened on 2026-10-02 by the owner's acceptance; see
[that amendment](#amended-2026-10-02-claude-code-is-accepted).

1. The Claude Code producer has its own gate, `annotations.CLAUDE_ABSTENTION_CHECK`, recorded
   `not-run` because no eligible recorded case exists for it. While it stays there, no route,
   fallback, unasked lane, goal summary, page or forged request can offer, select or invoke it.
   Codex's 2026-09-14 `accepted` status was a review of Codex readings, so it does not open this
   gate.
2. While Claude Code is gated, Codex keeps reading a Claude Code session on a machine that has
   Codex, and the disclosure before the press names Codex and OpenAI and says Claude Code checks
   are built but not yet qualified. On a machine without Codex, "not yet qualified" is a state of
   its own, worded apart from "not installed". Once the gate passes, item 4 applies as written:
   the session's own harness first, then the other provider, disclosed before the press, and
   nothing else.
3. Qualifying the producer is DRC-4666's work, scorer included. The unasked lane and goal
   summaries stay on Codex.

One resolver, `reading_route.resolve`, decides the provider from the session's harness and this
machine. It reads each provider's gate before it looks for that provider's CLI, so a gated
provider is never even looked up. The page renders the route published for that session's
harness. The reading route resolves the route again from the payload's harness and refuses a
press that named a different provider, before it writes consent or reserves an attempt.
Permission is kept per provider, because allowing Codex to send a reader's words to OpenAI is not
allowing Claude Code to send them to Anthropic. An answer saved before the split reads as Codex's.
Turning readings off and `--forget` revoke every provider, and the twelve-attempt rolling cap is
shared, so a second provider cannot double it. If the CLI is missing at launch, or a call fails,
nothing else is tried: a fresh press is the only retry. The flags the Claude Code call runs with,
and the fact that they are CLI restrictions rather than an OS sandbox, are in
[the light harness usage bounds](../SECURITY.md#claude-code-reading-calls).

### Amended 2026-09-24: Analyze drift and Allow and analyze

[DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
renames item 1's labels: the first press of "Analyze drift" shows the reading disclosure with "Allow
and analyze". Where the answer is kept, what `--forget` revokes and the off switch are unchanged.
Keep does not count as the allow (owner, 2026-09-27, superseding this amendment's first wording):
where the disclosure has not been allowed it settles and sends nothing, and "Allow and analyze"
does the sending. A cancelled analysis is a spent attempt against the cap.
[DEC-23](#dec-23-a-claude-code-sessions-record-of-its-checks-may-show-the-work) item 7 adds one
condition: the first reading that would send tool output needs a fresh "Allow and analyze" whose
disclosure names tool output and the receiving vendor as configured, and an answer given before that
does not cover it.

### Amended 2026-10-02: Claude Code is accepted

The owner, 2026-10-02: "I want you to accept the Claude Code checks so that Claude Code can be used
to check Claude Code sessions when Claude Code is running (or exists on the system)." This changes
item 1 of the 2026-09-23 amendment and leaves items 2 and 3 as they apply once the gate is open.

1. `annotations.CLAUDE_ABSTENTION_CHECK` is `accepted`. Every scored run failed, so this is the
   owner's acceptance and not a pass; DEC-17's
   [amendment of the same day](#amended-2026-10-02-the-owner-accepts-the-claude-code-producer-without-a-pass)
   and the [acceptance record](abstention/claude-acceptance.json) say so in full.
2. A Claude Code session is read by Claude Code when an absolute `claude` is on the server's PATH,
   and by Codex when it is not, which is item 4 as written. The disclosure before the press names
   whichever runs and its company, and on the Codex route says the Claude Code CLI was not found.
   With neither, the session says no analysis can run.
3. Item 4 also reaches the other way, as written: a session on any other harness, on a machine
   with `claude` and no `codex`, is read by Claude Code. Reworded (owner, 2026-10-02): the answer
   is kept per provider, so an Allow given for a provider covers every session routed to that
   provider. A reader who allowed Claude Code is not asked again for a Codex, Pi or other session
   that falls back to it; that route's disclosure, naming Claude Code and Anthropic, is in the
   session's "What is sent to Claude Code" popover beside Analyze drift, before the press.
   Allowing Codex does not allow Claude Code, so the first press routed to a provider with no
   Allow opens that provider's consent step.
4. The unasked lane and goal summaries stay on Codex, as item 3 of the 2026-09-23 amendment
   ruled, and the twelve-attempt rolling cap stays shared between providers.

`resolve` still reads each gate before it looks for that provider's CLI, so setting the constant
back to `not-run` closes the producer with no other change, and the "not qualified on this build"
sentences remain for that state.

### Amended 2026-10-02 (owner): the Allow is bound to where the words go

The owner, 2026-10-02: "bind the allow to the destination". The tool-output grant was already
keyed by destination (item 7 of DEC-23). The Allow for the reader's words was not, so a dashboard
restarted under a new `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` sent the goal and messages
to the new endpoint under the old Allow, and the new destination appeared only in a closed popover.
The binding catches that move only where the destination was named, as item 5 says.

1. An Allow records the destination its disclosure named: `reading_route.destination` for that
   provider, published on every route as `words_destination`. It covers a press only while that
   destination is exactly the one recorded. An unnamed destination (`""`) is its own value, so an
   Allow given while nothing could be named covers presses only while nothing still can. The
   tool-output grant keeps its own rule, and is never given to `""`.
2. The press handler, the job's reservation and the page decide it from one value. The board
   publishes `providers` as covered only where the recorded destination is today's, the press
   check reads the same, and the job resolves the destination again at its reservation and is
   refused `destination-changed`, with nothing spent or sent, when it is no longer the one the
   press was admitted under (consent F4, ui5): a managed drop-in or remote settings file can move
   it while the job collects the record. An Allow whose disclosure named a destination that is no
   longer today's is refused `409 destination-changed` and records nothing.
3. A row written before the binding records no destination, so it covers no press and each reader
   is asked once more. When an Allow on record does not cover today's destination, for that reason
   or because the destination moved, the consent step opens with the server's line "Where your
   words go has changed since you allowed this, so allow it again." A refusal is never asked
   about that way: "Turn off readings" and `--forget` hold whatever the destination.
4. The binding is a table of its own in the store, `permission_destination`, created in place
   inside the store's existing transaction. No column is added to an older table, so an older
   build's two-value writes still succeed against a migrated store, and an older build's Turn off
   clears every recorded destination by trigger, as it already clears every other answer.

5. What the binding detects is a change in what `destination` names. A named destination that
   moves is caught: to another host, to a cloud, or to unnamed. A move between two endpoints that
   cannot be named is not, because both are `""`, so an Allow given while the destination was
   unnamed keeps covering every endpoint it cannot name. That is every destination on Windows,
   where nothing is named and the Allow is in effect not bound. It is every Codex base URL, since
   `destination` names nothing wherever `OPENAI_BASE_URL` or `OPENAI_API_BASE` is set, so moving
   from one Codex base URL to another asks nothing; moving from OpenAI to one does. And it is every
   Claude Code setting SECURITY.md lists as naming nothing. The disclosure the reader answered says
   so: "wherever your ... settings send it, which Cargento cannot name". The owner's rule that
   unnamed is a value of its own (item 1) stands.
6. The unasked lane sends under the same binding (consent F5, ui5). It sends the goal and messages
   to Codex with nobody at the desk, so before each send, at the model seam, it asks whether a
   Codex Allow covers today's destination, as a press would. Where a press would ask again, the
   check is skipped and logged, nothing is spent, and the lane's own caps are unchanged.
7. An Allow that names no destination is never bound (regressions major 1, ui5). A tab left open
   across the upgrade sends one, and is refused `400 page-outdated`. The page from before the
   binding answers a `409` by drawing the consent card again under a line about tool output, so
   the reply carries the one thing that page shows verbatim: a route with no provider, whose note
   says to reload. The board also publishes its page's `build`, and a page from this build on
   shows one line, "Reload to use the new version.", when it changes under an open tab.

This stays per provider, as item 3 of the acceptance above says: an Allow given for a provider
covers every session routed to that provider, at the destination it was given for.

### Where the unasked default stands

The unasked check is the only model reading that finds drift nobody went looking for. DEC-18 gates its
default on four preconditions and on the rubric's acceptance thresholds. Measured 2026-09-23:

| Precondition | State | Settled by |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Native delivery on Linux and Windows | not met | `notifications.native_notifier` returns a backend on darwin only; DRC-4328 |
| The off machine lane | built | #356, DRC-4034 |
| A delivery outcome recorded per raise | built | #320, DRC-4540 |
| A producer exists | met | `unasked.Lane` and `reading.CodexReadingModel`, DRC-4511 |
| DEC-17's abstention check has run and passed | not met | Codex's check is `accepted` (2026-09-14) and Claude Code's `accepted` (2026-10-02), neither `passed`; every scored Claude Code run in [docs/abstention](abstention/README.md) failed |
| Quiet hours exist | met | #357, DRC-4032 |
| The rubric's acceptance thresholds | not written | DRC-4542 owns the case set; no threshold exists to meet |

Two rows are not met and one cannot be met until someone writes it. That is the list this ruling
leaves open.

## DEC-22: your own prompt may become your goal

Decided 2026-09-23 (DRC-4635). Built by DRC-4643: the annotation store keeps typed and explicitly
adopted words with their source.

Most sessions have no goal from the reader, so there is nothing to check drift against. The fastest
goal is the one the reader already gave the agent. Existing rulings settle what may not be adopted:
text the agent wrote is DEC-17's surviving failure class by construction, and an observer goal is
derived the way the observer snapshot is, which the rule 7 amendment calls "a paraphrase of the
session, not evidence about it", and a paraphrase is no better as a baseline. Workflow goals are refused too, because who wrote one is mixed and they
join on newlines where the typed fields are one line each.

1. The reader's latest prompt or first prompt may be adopted. The latest is what the board already
   shows: on Claude the `asked` instruction, the first line of the newest prompt clipped to 140
   characters; on Codex the published title, only when `states_work` accepts it, because Codex titles
   a bare continuation too. The first prompt is a new published field on both harnesses, admitted to
   the history prompt-text allowlist with its own reason.
2. On a session with no goal, "Check for drift" adopts the prompt the goal slot shows and checks
   against it, so the path is one press. Choosing the first prompt, or adopting without checking, is
   in the goal field.
3. An adopted revision stores its source prompt's time beside the save time, and DEC-16's
   later-instruction floor and reading eligibility key on the source time. Both keyed on the save
   time when this was decided, so adopting a first prompt would have settled every later instruction
   silently, and adopting on an ended session would have withheld the reading with a false reason.
   Codex now publishes the timestamp paired with its latest and first prompts. A missing or
   invalid source time still refuses adoption with a sentence saying why.
4. The mark, "from your prompt", shows in the goal's source line, in the reading's evidence line and
   in one sentence of the board-wide disclosure. Editing adopted words makes an ordinary typed
   revision, because the reader has then typed them.
5. Adopted words do not make a session eligible for the unasked lane, so one press on many rows
   cannot quietly widen what that lane spends.

Authorship is inferred, not proven. A prompt counts as the reader's because the harness recorded it
as a user message and the injected-prompt filter did not recognise it, and that filter fails open. A
dispatch prompt from an orchestrator or a headless run also arrives as a user message. The mark
exists so a reading against adopted words says where they came from.

A source token and a source time are new published fields and take the three hand declarations
AGENTS.md's Measured Invariants names. They need a DEC-15b admission only if the history copy keeps
provenance. The first prompt needs the allowlist admission above whatever else is decided.

### What prompt adoption preserves

The server accepts a closed latest/first choice and the displayed text/time pair, then resolves
that pair from its own row. A changed pair refuses rather than choosing new words silently.
Implicit adoption refuses an existing goal; an explicit first/latest choice also compares the
saved revision. Save time remains the time of the reader's act. Source time controls the later
direction floor and final-reading eligibility. The assessment carries its own source even after
its revision is evicted. Output-only edits preserve goal provenance; explicitly saving a goal
makes a typed revision even when the letters match. No adopted current goal enters the unasked
lane, including one with typed output or older typed revisions.

First prompts are bounded published excerpts, not full transcripts. The first-record scan reads
at most two MiB, refuses an unread prefix, and never calls a later record the first. Both source
controls show the excerpt before adoption; clipped sources are named as excerpts. The same
annotation scrub and 240-character bound apply on save.


### Amended 2026-09-24: the session page drafts from your first prompt

[DEC-24](#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
amends items 2 and 3. On a session with no saved goal, the session page's goal field shows your
first prompt as a draft marked "from your prompt", and pressing Analyze drift adopts that draft in
the same press. The evidence window of adopted words starts at their source time. A message that
matches a correction you copied is never adopted as a goal.

### Amended 2026-10-01: up to five of your prompts may be chosen

Owner, 2026-10-01 (Q7 of the DRC-4758 decision block), amending item 1 and "What prompt adoption
preserves". The closed latest/first choice gains a third source, `chosen-prompt`: one of up to five
of the reader's own prompts from the session's observed record, offered by "Use your prompt".

- The list is `annotations.prompt_choices`: the earliest prompt in the record first, then the most
  recent, a repeated text offered once, at most five. Each is a `user_message` fact of this session
  that `reading.author_of` calls the person's, with a valid time and its whole words. A correction
  copied from Cargento, a harness control and a local command are refused exactly as the
  first-prompt draft refuses them; a local command already reaches the record with no words.
- Each is resolved whole: its words as a reading reads them, clipped to the goal's 240-character
  cap with `cut` saying the offer is an excerpt. The text offered is the text an adoption stores.
- It is published only on the focused `/api/project-context` as `prompt_choices`, beside the
  levels, and never on `/api/data`. It is not stored, not in session history and not a history
  field. Only an adopted choice's words become `annotation_goal`, the path the first and latest
  prompt already take.
- An adoption names the fact id (`prompt_fact`) with the displayed text and time. The server
  recomputes the list from its own record and adopts only an entry with that id whose text and
  time still match, under the source token `chosen-prompt` and the entry's own time, which then
  keys the later-direction floor, eligibility and the evidence window as the other two sources do.
  A pasted correction's fact id, a forged id and changed words all adopt nothing.
- Adding a direction over an unsaved chosen draft is not built: `add_direction`'s adoption still
  resolves only first and latest, and refuses this source. The page says so beside the pending
  line, as it does over an unsaved edit, and sends nothing.

### Amended 2026-10-01: "Use your prompt" fills the goal box

Owner, 2026-10-01 (Q7, DRC-4758 slice D2), amending item 2's last sentence ("Choosing the first
prompt, or adopting without checking, is in the goal field") and "Both source controls show the
excerpt before adoption" under What prompt adoption preserves. The nested "Use a prompt" and
"Your latest prompt" disclosures and the "Use latest prompt without checking" save are removed.

- The goal's label row holds one `<details>` menu, summary "Use your prompt", listing the server's
  `prompt_choices` in their order as buttons: "First prompt", then "Latest prompt", then "Earlier
  prompt", each with its own time and its words clamped to two lines. Over a session that opened
  with a harness control the first entry is named "Earliest prompt", since it is not the first.
  An excerpt says "Shown excerpt only." in its option. A `<details>` of buttons rather than a
  listbox popover or a `<select>`, because the disclosure lane restores its open state across a
  poll redraw and each option keeps its own focus key, where a popover's open state and active
  option are lost on every redraw (DRC-4758 critic 14).
- Choosing one saves nothing. It fills the Goal box as a pending adoption, held in tab memory
  (`nextIntentChosenPrompts`) and returned by `nextIntentDraft`, so the draft's tint, its marks
  ("from your prompt · HH:MM", "Shown excerpt only." for an excerpt, Looks right until
  2026-10-02), Analyze's
  implicit adoption and Keep all read it. Focus moves to the box and the polite region says "Goal
  filled from your prompt. Not saved."
- Looks right, or Analyze over an empty goal, adopts it under `chosen-prompt` naming its fact id.
  Amended 2026-10-02 (owner): Save intent replaces Looks right as that press.
  Over a saved goal, Save intent adopts it with the saved revision, and Analyze is refused with the
  unsaved-edit sentence until then, because `/api/reading` refuses an implicit adoption over saved
  words. One keystroke in the box makes the words typed (item 4).
- The choice goes on Undo changes, Escape, Clear, a typed save, once its words are the saved goal,
  and once the server no longer offers the same words at the same time under that fact.

### Amended 2026-10-02 (owner): a native select

Owner, 2026-10-02 (ask 2): "When I said to make it a dropdown, I literally meant for you to make it
a Select dropdown." The `<details>` of buttons in the first bullet above sat at the right of the
label row and, opened, took the whole row, so "Use your prompt" flashed to the left and a 227px list
pushed the box down. It is now a native `<select>`, which supersedes that bullet's rationale (critic
14): the poll already defers its paint while a select holds focus (`next-render.js`, the row "An
open `<select>` option list" in [reader state](design-reader-state.md#the-inventory) owns it), so a
redraw does not shut the list mid-choice.

- The closed face reads "Use your prompt", at the right end of the Goal label row, at most 18rem
  wide. The browser's own list drops over the page and moves nothing. Its accessible name is "Fill
  the goal from one of your prompts".
- Each option reads `First prompt · 08:02 — Make the retry queue survive…`: the name as above, the
  time, "· excerpt" where the server clipped the prompt, and the words cut at a word near 60
  characters. The box always receives the whole prompt.
- A pick fills the box exactly as a choice did, and focus stays on the select, so arrowing through
  it where each arrow is a change previews each prompt in the box without moving the reader into
  it. A poll that waited while the list had focus is taken by the pick, so the page draws once.
- While the box holds the pick untouched the select shows it; the first keystroke puts the face
  back to "Use your prompt" in place, so the same prompt can be picked again.
- The draft's marks ("from your prompt · 08:02") and the saved source line sit in the row under
  the box, between the count and Clear, as an outcome line's source sits between its count and
  Remove. That row keeps one control's height and does not wrap. Both earlier places moved
  something, measured in Chrome at 1440x900. Drawn between the label and the select, the marks
  wrapped the select 48px down the moment a pick drew them. Drawn on a line of their own under
  the label row, they moved the box the pick fills 25px down, and the first keystroke pulled it
  back up under the caret. The select, the box and the Expected outcome field below it now hold
  their places at rest, after a pick, after typing and after a redraw, at 1440, 760 and 375.

### Amended 2026-10-04: an adopted goal is read whole

Owner, 2026-10-04, after
[the first drift replay run](drift-replay/README.md#the-first-run-2026-10-04): a goal adopted from
the opening prompt keeps 240 characters, and on Claude Code a latest prompt only its first line,
which in one session cut off the instruction that mattered and in another kept only plan-file
preamble.

- When the revision a reading reads was adopted (`goal_source` is one of the three prompt sources,
  with `goal_source_at`), the reading sends that prompt's whole words as the Goal the model reads,
  in place of the clip: the reader's own `user_message` at the source time, its `reader_words`, up
  to 1,000 characters, redacted as every reader's message is (`reading.adopted_prompt`). A copied
  correction is never the source; two prompts at the same moment are told apart by which one the
  goal's words open, and neither is guessed at.
- The stored goal, the page and the history keep the clip. Nothing new is stored or published, and
  the criterion's clause is still the goal box's words.
- The words come out of the reader's half of the prompt, before any other message is read whole,
  and only where the room left holds them, so they never cost an entry. That prompt's own row in the
  record then keeps its first sentence rather than sending the same words twice.
- If the prompt's words are no longer in the record, or have no room, the reading reads the clip
  and the cutoff sentence says which.
- The goal box tells the reader: where an adopted prompt was clipped, "Shown excerpt only." under the
  box is now "Excerpt. Analyze reads the whole prompt.", in the draft's marks and in the saved
  goal's source line alike. Short, because that row holds one control's height; the 375px layout was
  not re-measured in a browser for this change. "Use your prompt" still names an excerpt
  "· excerpt" in its option.

What is sent does not change in kind: the reader's own messages already go whole up to 1,000
characters ([the 2026-10-01 amendment](#amended-2026-10-01-a-reading-sees-the-readers-whole-message)),
and the adopted prompt is one of them.

## DEC-23: a Claude Code session's record of its checks may show the work

Decided 2026-09-24 (DRC-4674). DRC-4676 builds the record and keeps it off every model prompt.
DRC-4677 builds items 7 to 10 for the single Expected Output constraint: the tool-output grant keyed
by provider and destination, the destination named or refused, the result-bearing prompt row with
its output tail quoted as data, the reader's words reserved first in the byte bound, and item 8's
rules in the resolver and on the page, with the window read from the revision's stored window start
(DEC-24 item 13, built by DRC-4679), or from its `baseline_at` on a revision saved before it stored one. A pass that a later command may have changed files after, in
the same call or a later one, carries no `consistent` either (item 3's blocker, applied to a
reading). What counts as work is per harness: a work result on Pi and a check on Claude Code, and
never the agent's own final answer on Claude Code or Codex; on Pi the harness publishes its result as
work. The agent's account is not work. Since
[DEC-17's amendment of 2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence) one
of its messages may still carry a line's verdict, as what the agent said; a final answer may not.
Per-line outcome lines are DRC-4685's. SECURITY.md's
[Tool output in a Claude Code reading](../SECURITY.md#tool-output-in-a-claude-code-reading) says
what is sent and where.

A Claude Code reader who asks whether the session did what they asked gets "not verifiable" every
time, because the rule 7 amendment found that on Claude and Codex nothing in the record
demonstrates work. The Claude transcript does record every tool call and its result, and
`records.tool_outcome` already joins a call to its result by id and keeps the name only. DEC-5 let
the after-tool hook post a shape identifier and a tool name and nothing more. Pi, the one harness
whose record shows work, published only a derived count of validation checks passed, with no
command or output (`project_context._work_evidence`).

Pi's results now follow items 1, 2 and 8 as well (owner, 2026-09-27, DRC-4690). The count
grepped from any output read a failure as a pass, `0 passed` as a pass and `echo '5 passed'` as a
pass, and dropped a flagged failure entirely. A Pi validation run is now counted only for a runner
on the closed list, failure is read first, and a zero count is "ran, result not recorded". The
error flag is read as the 0.87.1 capture
([docs/captures/pi/validation-results-0.87.1-macos.jsonl](captures/pi/validation-results-0.87.1-macos.jsonl))
shows it: set with Pi's own "Command exited with code N" line it is a nonzero exit, set with a
timeout line it is a run with no result, and set with no status line the call never ran. The
latest run of each check is kept, and its fact carries `subject` and `result`, so item 8 applies
to it: `check_supports` now keys on a check on any harness, not only Claude Code's
`tool_report`. The title is Cargento's and no command or output is published.

Three rulings from the review round (2026-09-27) hold it there. A Pi check never enters the
semantic history store, as item 6 already said of Claude Code's: the store keeps an allowlist of
fact keys without `subject` or `result`, so a superseded pass came back from it as a bare "5
validation checks passed" that nothing could supersede or age, and it carried a `consistent` while
the latest run had failed. A subjectless Pi bash result already on disk from an older build,
including the pass the build before this read from `echo '5 passed'`, supports no verdict at all.
A clear or absent flag beside Pi's own exit line is outside what the capture shows, since a
`tool_result` extension can clear the flag on a call that threw, so such a run is never a pass.
And every Pi tool except `read`, `grep`, `find` and `ls` ages an earlier pass, `powershell` and
extension tools included: guessing that an unknown tool only reads is what would produce a false
`consistent`.

The ruling is yes, bounded, and readable by a model. Two other answers were put beside it. Page
only, never sent to a model, shows the work but leaves no reading able to judge Expected Output on
Claude Code. Refusing leaves every check on a Claude Code session not verifiable. What the ruling
costs is a new content class that leaves the machine under the destination rule in item 7, and a
new surviving failure class: a false `consistent` resting on a success the tool reported. DRC-4666
qualifies the producer against it.

1. Three things are never conflated: what was run, what the harness recorded as its result, and
   whether the requested outcome exists, which Cargento never claims. Evidence is the recorded
   result. A background launch is not a success, and an absent or malformed error flag is unknown,
   never success. `records.tool_outcome` turns an absent flag into `False` today, and that is the
   reading this item refuses.
2. A check's result comes from one of three sources, in this order, and otherwise reads "ran,
   result not recorded". First, the harness's explicit error flag, which is the whole call's status
   and is attributed as the closed lists set out: a pipe into `tail`, `head` or `grep` reports the
   last stage. Second,
   a runner summary line in the recorded output tail, from the closed set below. Third, for failure
   only, a failure marker in the recorded output tail, from the closed set below, which may record
   a failure and never a pass. Output text is never read as success any other way.
3. A check is a shell command whose runner is on the closed list below, matched per segment, split on
   `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&` and newlines, after stripping `cd ...`, `NAME=value` assignments and the wrappers the list names.
   The shell's `test` and `[` builtins are never checks. Among shell commands, only checks can
   support a departure or be cited in a correction (DEC-24 item 7); a person's or the agent's own
   words keep what DEC-17 and DEC-24 items 6 and 9 let them support. Other commands and probes, such as a
   `grep` with no match or an `ls` of a missing path, are counted and not listed. A segment that is
   neither a check nor on the closed read-only list below may change files without the transcript
   recording a write, so one run after any check's latest passing run blocks the live estimate's
   "None or low" (DEC-26 item 1). It is never counted as drift. The owner ruled this on review the same day,
   as part of this ruling.
4. For each distinct check only its latest run is listed and counts, and it says when an earlier
   run of the same check failed without listing that run. A file write after a passing run marks
   that pass as before the last change. At most 12 entries are listed, chosen in this order: latest
   runs that failed, then latest runs with no recorded result, then latest runs that passed, then
   written paths, newest first within each. The rest are counted ("and N more"). Every answer about
   checks is derived from the full scan, never from the listed entries alone, so a dropped entry
   can never produce "No check was recorded" or a reassuring answer.
5. Fields read: the check's own segment, its runner form and arguments and never the rest of the
   shell line (the owner narrowed this on review the same day, as part of this ruling), after
   credential redaction and masking, word by word, of the forms redaction cannot recognise: a
   `NAME=value` assignment; the value after `--password`, `--token`, `--api-key`, `--secret`,
   `--auth`, `-p` or `-P`, joined by `=` or in the next word; an `Authorization:` or `X-Api-Key:`
   header value; and the password in `user:password@`, up to the last `@`. These forms and no
   others, as SECURITY.md says. A substituted command is shown as `$(…)` and a trailing comment is
   dropped. Clipped to 120 characters; the last 180 characters of
   output, the existing ledger cap, with redaction run over the whole read window first; a
   written path relative to the working directory; and, for a segment that is neither a check nor
   on the read-only list, its time only, never its text, used on this machine. No file content is read as a field, and never an
   Edit or Write result body; the output tail is whatever the runner printed.
6. Where it lives: the observed record only, as a new fact type the reading counts as work. It is
   kept out of the semantic history store and out of every session row field, and it is named in
   `history.PROMPT_DERIVED_CARRIERS`. SECURITY.md adds it to the named reads, moving the count
   `test_documentation` pins, and scopes the irreversible-actions sentence about tool output.
7. Where it may go: to the reading producer that reads the session, or to the fallback route
   `reading_route.resolve` selects and discloses before the press, and on either only after a fresh
   "Allow and analyze" (DEC-21's "Allow and check" as DEC-24 item 5 renames it) whose disclosure
   names tool output and the receiving vendor. An answer given before tool output was named does not
   cover it. The disclosure names the destination as configured, including an `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
   Bedrock or Vertex setting in the daemon's environment or in managed settings, which still apply
   under `--restricted`. Where the destination cannot be named, tool output is not sent. Those
   settings are examples, and SECURITY.md names the Codex route's equivalent. The live drift
   estimate (DEC-26) is a further consumer on the machine: it derives a level from these facts,
   published on the session payload only, never on a row, in history or in any off-machine payload.
8. What a reading may conclude. The latest run of a relevant check failing inside the evidence
   window may support a departure. A `consistent` on Expected Output needs the latest run of a
   relevant check passing inside the window with no later write, and is labelled as reported by the
   tool, not inspected. Absence supports neither. DEC-24 item 13 sets the evidence window.
9. Tool output is quoted into the reading's prompt as untrusted data, never into an instruction
   Cargento writes.
10. The unasked lane never receives tool outcomes until DEC-18's rubric thresholds exist.

This amends the rule 7 amendment of 2026-09-10, whose "On Claude and Codex nothing does" no longer
holds for a Claude Code check; DEC-17 carries the amendment.

### The closed lists

The producer prompt states item 8's relevance rule for the whole Goal or outcome line, outside
the reader's words and quoted tool output. A generic passing suite does not establish a feature or
browser behavior that it does not exercise. Relevance remains a model judgement: the resolver
checks the recorded status, time and subsequent changes, but does not prove semantic coverage.
These instructions do not establish a passing qualification or open the Claude Code gate.
One class of line is the server's to settle instead: see
[the 2026-10-01 amendment](#amended-2026-10-01-a-line-about-what-the-agent-tells-you-cannot-be-shown).

The owner kept that admission contract on 2026-09-30 (DRC-4749). A command-status-only rule would
make ordinary feature and browser clauses not verifiable even when a relevant check ran. Keyword
overlap and a coverage flag supplied by the model would instead call an unproved connection proof.
The record scan selects each check's latest run. The resolver enforces what that selected record
can settle: provenance, result, evidence window and later changes. An always-consistent fake model
can test those guards and the agent-account boundary, but cannot establish whether an arbitrary
check covers a whole requested outcome. A fresh recorded DEC-17 qualification must include
premarked cases where a passing check does not cover the requested feature or browser behavior to
measure that semantic failure class; its general coverage floor alone does not require them. That
qualification was to keep the Claude Code producer gate closed until it passed; the owner's acceptance of
2026-10-02 opened it without one ([the amendment](#amended-2026-10-02-claude-code-is-accepted)).

Writing these lists out is part of item 3, which names the kinds (test, build, lint and type-check
runners) and leaves the list to this section. Each segment, split on `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&` and newlines, is matched
after stripping `cd ...`, `NAME=value` assignments and the wrappers `uv run`, `poetry run`,
`pipenv run`, `npx`, `pnpm exec`, `bunx`, `timeout N`, `time`, `rtk` and `env NAME=value`. The list is closed: a runner not
named here is not a check. The owner ruled `rtk` a wrapper on 2026-09-24, with one rule of its own:
because rtk may rewrite a runner's output, a check it wraps takes its result from the error flag
only, never from a summary line or a failure marker. `env`, named by its path or not, strips only
assignments, `-i`, `--ignore-environment`, `-`, `-u NAME`, `-uNAME`, `--unset NAME`,
`--unset=NAME` and `--`; `env -S`, `env -C` and every other option leave it unread.

The shell wrappers are `bash -c`, `sh -c`, `zsh -c` and `bash -lc`: the command string is parsed
again, and its segments stand in for the wrapper's segment. They were added on 2026-09-25; the
amendment below says how they are read.

Runners, matched on the first word or words of a stripped segment:

- Test: `pytest`, `py.test`, `python -m pytest`, `python3 -m pytest`, `python -m unittest`,
  `python3 -m unittest`, `nose2`, `tox`, `nox`, `node --test`, `npm test`, `npm run test`,
  `pnpm test`, `pnpm run test`, `yarn test`, `bun test`, `deno test`, `jest`, `vitest`, `mocha`,
  `go test`, `cargo test`, `cargo nextest`, `mvn test`, `gradle test`, `./gradlew test`,
  `dotnet test`, `rspec`, `bundle exec rspec`, `rake test`, `phpunit`, `swift test`, `ctest`,
  `make test`, `make check`, and a program file whose name holds `test` or `tests` as a word of its
  own, with the name split on `_`, `-` and `.`: `run_tests.py`, `./test.sh` and
  `python3 scripts/run_tests.py` count, and `runtests.py` and `fetch_latest_creds.py` do not. Never
  the shell's `test` or `[` builtins.
- Build: `npm run build`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm run build`, `yarn build`, `bun run build`,
  `cargo build`, `go build`, `make build`, `mvn package`, `gradle build`, `./gradlew build`,
  `dotnet build`, `swift build`, `vite build`, and `tsc` without `--noEmit`.
- Lint: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `flake8`, `pylint`, `black --check`, `eslint`,
  `prettier --check`, `stylelint`, `golangci-lint`, `cargo clippy`, `rubocop`, `shellcheck`.
- Type-check: `mypy`, `pyright`, `tsc --noEmit`, `cargo check`, `go vet`.

Read-only commands, matched the same way, for segments that are not checks: `git status`,
`git log`, `git diff`, `git show`, `git rev-parse`, `git merge-base`, `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`,
`grep`, `rg`, `find`, `wc`, `pwd`, `echo`, `which`, `file`, `stat`, `tree` and `less`; the portable
`date` display forms (no arguments or one `+format`, optionally with `-u`, `--utc` or `--universal`);
and REST `gh api` with one endpoint, no field, body, header or cache flags, and no method or an
explicit `GET`. Its accepted options are `--paginate`, `--slurp`, `--silent`, `--include`, `-i`,
`--verbose`, `--allow-escape-sequences`, `--jq`, `-q`, `--template`, `-t` and `--hostname`, plus
`--method` or `-X` for `GET`. Unknown options and the `graphql` endpoint stay changes. This is a
closed set: numeric clock-setting operands and GNU `date --set` stay changes, and BSD date parsing
forms are left unread. GitHub CLI fields imply `POST` unless a method overrides them, but field
forms remain outside this set even with explicit `GET`.
Any other segment that is not a check, run after
any check's latest passing run, is the blocker item 3 names. This list is closed too. A segment is
not read-only, whatever its command, when it holds a command or process substitution whose own
command is not read-only by these same rules, a redirect `>` into anything but `/dev/null` or
another descriptor, or a writing option: `find -delete`, `-exec`, `-execdir`, `-ok`, `-fprint`, `-fprint0`, `-fprintf` or
`-fls`, `tree -o`, and `git diff`, `git log` or `git show` with `--output`.

Formatters and fixers are changes: `prettier --write`, `black` without `--check`, `ruff format`
without `--check`, and any run with `--fix` or `--write`, `ruff check --fix` and `eslint --fix`
among them. A change ages every earlier pass as a recorded write does, and a check that fixes, or a
fixer later in the same call, ages that check's own pass, so no timestamp tie inside one call hides
it.

The error flag, source (i), is the status of the whole call, not of one segment. The orchestrator
clarified how it is attributed on 2026-09-24, in the withholding direction, after review found a
failure credited to a check that never ran and a pass credited to one whose execution was unknown:

- a passing flag with only `&&` joiners in the call passes every check in it, because a chain of
  `&&` that exits zero ran every stage and each exited zero;
- a passing flag otherwise speaks only for a check that is the last segment of the call;
- a failing flag is attributed only to a check that is the last segment of the call, and every
  other check in that call reads "ran, result not recorded";
- summary lines and failure markers attribute only when the call holds exactly one check;
- anything after `||` has unestablished execution, so the flag says nothing about it and it reads
  "ran, result not recorded";
- `&` sends the whole `&&`/`||` list before it to the background, back to the previous `;`,
  newline or `&`, so `pytest && echo started &` runs pytest in the background.

The orchestrator clarified the attribution further on 2026-09-24, in the withholding direction,
after a verifier reproduced false results against the first clarification:

- a result Claude Code records as moved to the background ("Command running in background with
  ID", or "Command did not complete within its N s timeout and was moved to the background") makes
  every check in that call a background run: no result, and it supersedes as unrecorded;
- a failing flag is a run that exited nonzero only when the result opens `Exit code N` with N above
  zero; any other failing result is a call that never ran (a rejection, a cancelled parallel call, a
  sibling error, a hook block or an input error), so it is no run, is not listed and supersedes
  nothing;
- a failing flag is attributed only when the call holds exactly one segment after stripping `cd`,
  assignments and wrappers; otherwise every check in it reads "ran, result not recorded";
- summary lines and failure markers attribute only when the call holds exactly one check,
  background ones counted, and no other segment that is not read-only;
- beside a passing flag, only a failure summary line makes the check failed; a failure marker alone
  makes it "ran, result not recorded";
- an `rtk` check with a passing flag and failure text in its output reads "ran, result not
  recorded", never passed.

DRC-4733 tightens the output attribution rule on 2026-09-29. Read-only means a command does not
record a change; it does not mean the command's output came from a check. Summary lines, failure
markers and Pi's check counts attribute only to a single check with no independent output-producing
segment. A following `head` or `tail` with a numeric line or byte limit, or `grep` with its pattern,
may preserve that attribution when connected only by pipes and reading only stdin. File operands,
an input redirect, another print before or after the check, and a preceding `cd` that can print its
destination withhold it. `pytest || echo '5 passed'` and `pytest; echo '5 passed'` therefore read
"ran, result not recorded". A trustworthy passing `&&` flag still establishes a pass, but an
independent print never supplies its count. The read-only list and write-ageing rules are unchanged.

Summary lines, source (ii), read from the recorded output tail, may record a pass or a failure:
pytest's `N passed`, `N failed` and `N error` or `N errors`; unittest's `OK`, only as the whole line, and `FAILED (`; jest's
and vitest's `Tests:` line with its passed and failed counts; node's `ℹ pass N` and `ℹ fail N`
lines, where `ℹ fail 0` is a pass; cargo's `test result: ok` and `test result: FAILED`; mypy's
`Success: no issues found` and `Found N errors`; ruff's `All checks passed!` and `Found N errors`.
A pass needs a pass pattern and nothing in the same tail that records a failure: a failed count
above zero, a failure summary or a failure marker. So `1 failed, 9 passed` is a failure. go prints
`ok  <pkg>` once per package, so a later package's `ok` cannot vouch for the run, and it is never
read as a pass. go's `FAIL` is a failure, and a go pass comes from the error flag alone. ruff's
`Found N error (N fixed, 0 remaining)` after a fix is not a failure summary, and neither is
eslint's `(0 errors, N warnings)`. A pass whose count
is zero (`ℹ pass 0`, `0 passed`, `Ran 0 tests`), or a go run reporting `[no tests to run]`, or
`[no test files]` with no package reporting `ok`, reads "ran, result not recorded". Failure evidence
outranks a passing flag: when the flag passes and the tail holds a failure summary, the check
failed, since a script can swallow its runner's exit status; a failure marker alone withholds the
pass instead.

Failure markers, source (iii), read from the recorded output tail as evidence of failure only:
node's `✖` test lines, `failing tests:` and `ℹ cancelled N` above zero (a timed-out test prints
`ℹ fail 0` beside it and exits 1), `AssertionError`, `ERR_ASSERTION`, pytest's `FAILED ` and `ERROR `,
go's `--- FAIL:`, cargo's `panicked at`, and tsc's `error TS`. tsc prints nothing on success, so
its pass comes only from the error flag.

The owner settled these points on review the same day, as part of the ruling rather than as an
amendment: a program file counts only when `test` or `tests` stands alone as a word in its name; a
summary-line pass counts only when nothing in the same tail records a failure, a go pass comes only
from the error flag, and unittest's `OK` counts only as the whole line; and the read-only list above.
The orchestrator added, on review the same day and in the withholding direction: the error-flag
attribution above, failure evidence outranking a passing flag, node's `ℹ cancelled N`, and go's
`[no test files]`. The owner added `rtk` as a wrapper whose checks read the flag alone.

#### Amended 2026-10-01: a line about what the agent tells you cannot be shown

Narrowed by
[DEC-17's amendment of 2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence):
the agent's messages are now in the record, so such a line stands where one of them is among what
it rests on, and is withdrawn as below where none is.

Owner ruling, DRC-4742. Three scored Claude Code qualification runs have failed DEC-17's check, and
the third had one false reassurance. The reader had asked the agent to run `node --test
tests/game.test.js` once more, unpiped, and report the counts. The outcome line said the check "is
run once, unpiped, and its counts are reported", and the reading called it `consistent`, citing
the passing run. The key says abstain. A record can show that a check ran and what it returned. It
cannot show what the agent then told the reader, and the agent's own account carries no outcome
verdict under [rule 7](#amended-2026-09-10-rule-7-asks-whether-an-entry-shows-work-not-who-typed-it).
The producer instruction from #450 already told the model that a passing suite cannot prove a run
count or piping it did not exercise, and that test counts are not the agent's report to the person.
The model gave the same verdict anyway.

The owner chose a server-side rule over more prompt wording. When an outcome line's own text says
the agent reports, tells, explains, summarises, says, describes or mentions something, or lets the
reader know, the resolver withdraws a `consistent` on that line to not verifiable. The stored
reason is `tells-the-person`, and the page says the line is about what the session told you, which
nothing in the record can show. The existing `check-does-not-show-it` sentence was not reused,
because it says the check's latest run did not pass with no change after it, and here it did.

Matching is on whole words and ignores case, and it reads the whole line rather than the
240-character clause stored on the row, so a telling word past that cap still counts. "Report"
matches as a noun as well as a verb, and "reporter", "reportage" and "sayings" do not match. The
one other exclusion is a word followed directly by `.` or `/` and then a letter, digit or
underscore, such as `report.csv` or `reports/summary.md`. Nothing else about paths or tools is
read, so "src/report", "~/report", "report-card.js", "npm run report", "the CLI reports 0 failures"
and "describe blocks pass" all abstain. That over-abstains on purpose: the ruling accepts it, and
telling the agent's account apart from a tool's would mean parsing the line's grammar.

The rule only ever moves a verdict toward abstaining. A departure on such a line stands, the Goal
is never touched, and a line that already rests only on the agent's account keeps rule 7's
`no-work-shown`. It runs in `reading._evidence_rules`, which every reading goes through, the
unasked lane included. The drift level that `levels.analysis_level` derives from a stored reading
runs the same resolver over each line's text, so a `consistent` stored before this rule existed
does not count as shown there either.

This knowingly narrows the coverage ruling above (DRC-4749), which left relevance to the model.
For this one class of line the server decides, because a passing check cannot speak to it whatever
the model concludes. More prompt wording was the alternative, and it was rejected because #450 had
already tried it and the next scored run produced this failure.

### What was measured before the text was fixed

On this repository's own transcripts, measured 2026-09-24, 775 of 848 test and lint runs were piped
and 1 set `pipefail`. That is why the error flag counts only when the runner is the final stage. A
list that matched only a command's leading form found 14 of 941 real check invocations, which is
why a check is matched per segment after stripping.

Five recorded Claude Code sessions the same day (Haiku 4.5; the session ids are on DRC-4673)
changed the ruling twice. Node's test runner prints its summary in its own form, so that form joined
the summary set. And a failing `node --test 2>&1 | tail -20` was recorded with the error flag
false. Node prints its failure details after its summary, so `tail` cut the summary line out, and
the last 180 characters held only the assertion object (`code: 'ERR_ASSERTION'`, `actual`,
`expected`). Under the flag and the summary line alone that run reads "ran, result not recorded",
never a failure; unpiped, the same failure sets the flag. The failure markers were added for it, and
because a marker can only record a failure, it cannot produce a false pass.

The same sessions confirmed item 1. A background launch records only a "will notify" result, and its
output is read later through a file Read, so it is never a recorded result. The field names these
readings rely on are in
[the transcript capture](captures/claude/transcript-tool-shapes-2.1.281-macos.jsonl). It also shows
the limit on writes: a shell command's result records its command and output and no path, so a
written path comes only from a file-write tool call, and a file a shell command changes is not a
recorded write. A check's own redirect into a file is the one exception since 2026-09-27; see
[the amendment of that date](#amended-2026-09-27-a-subshell-a-checks-own-redirect-a-write-at-the-same-time-and-when-a-result-arrived).

### Amended 2026-09-24: the live estimate reads these facts on the machine

[DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn) amends items 6 and 7. The
drift level is a derived state of the tool-outcome facts. It is published on the session payload
only, never on a row, in history or in an off-machine payload, and item 6's rule that nothing enters
a row field or the semantic history store holds for the level as it does for the facts.

### Amended 2026-09-25: one parser reads the line, shell wrappers, and unbalanced quoting

The owner ruled on DRC-4703 after the check line was found to leak on odd quoting, and a
four-lens review on 2026-09-27 tightened the parser; its changes are folded into the items below. A regex tokenizer,
a line-based heredoc strip and `shlex` read each line, and when `shlex` failed on an unterminated
quote the fallback split the value on spaces and masked only its first word. Over 8 masked forms,
9 quoting styles and 3 positions, 114 of 216 cases published at least half of a two-word placeholder secret, and the
check line is also the prompt row, so each leak reached the model. This amends item 3's stripping,
item 5's fields and the closed lists.

1. One parser. `project_context._ShellLexer` reads the call once, the way the shell does, into
   segments of decoded words: the words the program receives. It reads single and double quotes,
   `$'…'` with bash's escapes decoded, `$"…"` as a double-quoted string, a backslash-newline as
   nothing, `$(…)`, backticks and process substitutions to their matching end, and a comment at a
   word start. A `${…}` expansion is read whole, so a quoted `}` or a `)` inside it closes nothing,
   and inside a substitution a `case` pattern's `)` closes nothing either. `$((…))` and a `((…))`
   command are arithmetic, so `<<` in them is a shift. A redirection (`>out`, `2>&1`, `&>`, `<in`, `{fd}>`,
   `<<<`, a heredoc operator) ends the word before it and is kept apart from the words, because the
   shell strips it before the program receives its arguments: `--password 2>&1 value` reaches the
   program as a flag and its value side by side. A heredoc is recognised only as an unquoted `<<` or
   `<<-`, its delimiter is any word, quote-removed, and each body is read in order after the line
   ends. Quoting any part of the delimiter makes the body literal. In an unquoted body, command
   substitutions execute even between literal quote marks; backslash quotes `$`, backtick and
   backslash, and a backslash-newline joins only when the backslash was not itself escaped. Joining
   precedes delimiter matching, so a continued body line cannot expose later literal commands.
   Only those substitutions are read for their effects, never literal body lines, and no body text is
   published. The nesting bound still applies through a body inside a substitution.
   A body without its closing line runs to the end of the call, as bash reads it. Before this,
   a quoted `<<END` hid every line after it and a delimiter such as `MY-EOF` was not recognised, so
   its body was read as commands.
2. Unbalanced quoting means the call did not run. An unterminated `'`, `"`, `$'`, `$(`, `${` or
   backtick, and a heredoc operator or redirection with no word after it, is a syntax error in every
   shell. The call is not listed, it is counted in `not_run`, and nothing from its text is published.
   It still counts as a change, because bash runs the complete lines before it, so an earlier pass
   ages. A raw NUL in the command, nesting deeper than 32 substitutions or expansions, and any other
   fault in the parser are read the same way. A shell wrapper whose command string is unbalanced is
   different: the inner shell fails and the rest of the call runs, so only that wrapper segment is
   unread, and it is a change. A trailing lone backslash is not unbalanced: measured, bash runs the
   line and passes no argument for it.
3. `bash -c`, `sh -c`, `zsh -c` and `bash -lc` are runner wrappers. A shell
   named by its path counts. The option set is closed: single-letter clusters over `e`, `u`, `l` and
   `c`, `-o pipefail`, `--login`, `--noprofile` and `--norc`, with `-c` the last option and
   exactly one command word after it. Words after that are `$0` and the positional arguments, and
   are neither matched as runners nor published. Their named values still enter private masking
   and written-path withholding. The command word is parsed again and its segments are spliced
   in place of the wrapper's: the last inner segment takes the wrapper's joiner, so every attribution
   rule applies unchanged and only withholds. A wrapper sent to the background sends every inner
   segment with it, a background launch inside one is counted, a redirection on the wrapper applies
   to every inner segment, and a `cd` inside a wrapper does not carry past it. `-x` is left out,
   because xtrace echoes every word, a masked value included, into the output the prompt row
   carries. Only the inner segment is
   published, and a check's identity is its directory and inner segment, so `bash -c 'pytest'` and
   `pytest` in one directory are one check. Nesting stops at two wrappers; a third, or any other
   option, leaves the segment unread: not a check, and a change.
4. `env NAME=value cmd` is a wrapper, stripping the options the closed lists name. `env -S`
   re-splits a string and `env -C` changes directory, so neither is a wrapper, and neither is any
   other `env` option.
5. Masking reads decoded words. Because the parser decodes quoting first, one word holds a whole
   quoted value, and every named form masks it whole however it was quoted. The password in
   `user:password@` is masked up to the last `@` in the word, whitespace included. A NUL decoded
   from `$'…'` ends that string, as it ends the argument the program receives. An unquoted word
   holding a brace expansion (`{a,b}`, `{x..y}`) is published as `…`, since the words it becomes are
   unknown, and so is the word after it, since `--{x,password} value` expands to a named flag and
   its value. Each named value masked anywhere in the call, assignments, wrapper arguments and
   executed substitutions included, and each piece of it of four characters or more, is also
   removed from the output tail
   before redaction and clipping. Literal and shell re-quoted spellings, including xtrace's split
   apostrophe, match at filename and identifier boundaries, so masking `test` leaves `test_a.py`,
   `contest` and `src/test` readable. A wrapper's script is read as its inner words rather than as
   one assignment value; its ordinary runner and summary words are not masked. The named forms
   are unchanged: these forms and no others. Short pieces and arbitrary encodings remain outside
   this scrub.
6. A redirection is not an argument and is not published: not its target, not a here-string's
   word, not a heredoc's delimiter. A heredoc body and a here-string word are stdin data. Amended
   2026-09-27: a check segment's redirect target inside the working directory is published as a
   written path, below. The operator and decoded target stay separate: `> '&1'` writes a file
   named `&1`, whereas `>&1` duplicates a descriptor and `>&-` closes one. A named descriptor
   redirect into `/dev/null` remains harmless. An input redirect on a pipeline filter, heredocs
   included, cannot credit that input's summary to the check upstream.
7. A substitution runs whatever it names. A command or process substitution anywhere in a call, in
   a check's own arguments, an assignment, a redirection target or a wrapper's other words, counts
   as a change unless its own command is read-only by the closed lists, read with these same rules.
   A segment that is only a redirection into a file (`> build/output`) writes that file, so it is a
   change too.
   `$((…))` is arithmetic and runs nothing unless it holds a substitution. Nested executable
   commands supply private named values without reading arithmetic literal text as shell commands;
   arithmetic holding a substitution keeps its unknown, changing classification. Single quote
   characters there, including the `$'…'` spelling, do not suppress nested command execution; a
   command can emit its named value before the expanded expression errors. A file redirect
   inside an executable body is checked before the empty-word and `cd` shortcuts, so neither can
   hide a write. This also settles
   DRC-4724's second acceptance criterion.

No published field was added or removed. Titles change for a wrapper and for values that are now
masked whole, and the scan counts move with the segmentation. Measured on this machine's
transcripts (counts only, 2026-09-25 and 2026-09-27): a line continuation had added a false change
after the check in 237 of 429 check calls that used one, and it adds none now. Those calls fall to
142 holding a check, because the old reading made each continued line its own segment, so a test file
named on one was read as a check. Of 315 shell `-c` calls, 6 are now read as checks, against 2
before, and 21 calls are now not run for unbalanced quoting. After the change the same matrix, with
the wrappers added, leaks in none of its 1,944 cases.

The review round's own figures, measured 2026-09-27 on the same transcripts (counts only): 18 more
calls are read as not run, 17 of them holding a raw NUL and 1 that both `bash -n` and `zsh -n`
reject. 700 calls stopped reading as a change, 489 of them because a `>` inside quotes is an
argument and not a redirection, and most of the rest because their substitution runs only
read-only commands; `shlex` finds a file write in 1 of the 700, the check's own redirect, which
DRC-4709 owns. 319 calls became a change, nearly all an assignment whose substitution runs
something. The matrix, with newline quotings and an unterminated `$'` added, leaks in none of its
2,592 cases.

### Amended 2026-09-27: a subshell, a check's own redirect, a write at the same time, and when a result arrived

The owner ruled on DRC-4702, DRC-4709 and DRC-4724 on 2026-09-27. This amends item 3 of the
2026-09-25 amendment (a subshell is read as a wrapper is), its item 6 (a check's redirect target),
and item 3's measured note that a written path comes only from a file-write tool call.

1. A `(` at command position opens a subshell, and its matching `)` restores the directory that was
   current at the `(`, as a shell wrapper already did. `(cd sub && pytest); pytest` runs its second
   check in the working directory, so a failure in `sub` is no longer superseded by a pass outside
   it. A `)` that matches no `(`, such as a `case` arm's, and the parentheses of `f()` or
   `a=(1 2)`, open and close nothing. No published byte changed; only a check's identity moved.
   Measured on this machine's transcripts (counts only): 7 of 9,703 check calls change directory,
   and none gains or loses a check. DRC-4727, DRC-4728 and DRC-4730 amend placement on 2026-09-29: unquoted
   braces and `then` put their commands in the current shell, so a brace group's `cd` persists
   after `}`. Conditional arms and the commands after an `if` or `case` leave relative placement
   unknown when the recorded call cannot establish which branch ran. A `case` pattern's `)` closes
   no enclosing subshell, and `time ( ... )` opens one. A `cd` in a pipeline or background list does
   not move the foreground shell. A nonempty explicit `CDPATH` makes a relative destination unknown;
   a literal absolute `cd` or the enclosing subshell's close restores placement. A `cd` after `do`
   is still outside the supported placement forms. When Claude's recorded cwd can no longer place
   a check, its private identity is specific to that call and segment. It cannot supersede a known
   check or another unplaced run. Checks in a known directory still share their existing identity;
   no guessed folder is published.
2. A file redirect on a check segment is a recorded write by its call, its target read from the
   directory that segment ran in. A target inside the working directory is published as a written
   path, as a file-write tool's path is, through the same redaction. A target outside it, or one the
   shell decides when it runs (a `$` expansion, a substitution, `~`, a withheld word), is counted in
   `outside_paths` and never published. So is a target that masking would change, or that holds
   any value masked anywhere in the call, assignments included, since the check row beside it
   shows that value masked. A `cd` the shell resolves at run time (`~`, `$VAR`, a substitution,
   no argument, `-`), and `pushd` or `popd`, leave the directory unknown until a literal absolute
   `cd` or the group's close places it again, and a relative target under an unknown directory
   counts outside. `-L`, `-P`, `-e`, `-@` and `--` are options to `cd`, not directories. A group's
   or a wrapper's own redirect (`(cd sub && pytest) > out`) is read from the directory the group
   started in, where the outer shell opens it. A redirect into `/dev/null`, `/dev/stdout`,
   `/dev/stderr`, `/dev/tty` or `/dev/fd/N`, by any operator, writes no file. The redirect does
   not age its own check's pass. It ages an earlier check in the same call, setting both
   `before_last_change` and `changed_after`, and any pass from an earlier call, and it does not
   set `last_changing_command_at`, because it is now a recorded write. Measured (counts only): 90
   redirect targets on check segments, every one counted outside. The analysis had counted 9 inside,
   and all 9 were `$VAR` targets, whose path the shell picks at run time.
3. A write or fixer run from another call, recorded at the same time as a pass, ages it, since the
   recorded times cannot say which came first. The pass's own call is still ordered by its segments,
   so `black . && pytest` keeps its pass current: a tie rule without that exclusion aged 11 of the
   747 fixer-before-check calls measured. No check call shared a time with a file write.
4. Each recorded foreground check run publishes `result_at`, the time of the record holding its
   result. A background run, or one with no result yet, has none. `at` stays the call time, so the
   fact id, the page's order and its numbers do not move when a result lands. The result time
   decides the evidence window and which run of a check is latest. Every change comparison
   (`before_last_change`, `changed_after`, the live floor's changing-command time) keeps the call
   time, because in 291 of 9,544 measured checks a changing command started while the check ran,
   and a result time would read it as before the pass. `reading.evidence_at` is the one helper, the
   page's `nextReadingEvidenceAt` is its copy, and a test runs both window rules over one table.
   With two parallel runs of one check, the published run can swap when the earlier call's result
   lands after the later call's, which moves the fact id. A stored citation of the old id then
   reads uncited, which errs safe.

DRC-4709's third item, a subagent's writes, landed with DRC-4687 in
[the amendment of 2026-09-28](#amended-2026-09-28-a-subagents-checks-and-writes-are-the-parents).

### Amended 2026-09-28: a subagent's checks and writes are the parent's

The owner ruled on DRC-4687 and on DRC-4709's subagent item together on 2026-09-28: count both
ways. A subagent's checks count for the parent session, labelled as the subagent's, and its writes
count against the parent's earlier passes. Landing only the writes would have marked down exactly
the sessions that delegated their tests, since their subagent's edits would age a pass while its
checks went uncredited. This amends item 3's "a shell command", item 4's "each distinct check" and
the measured note that DEC-23 reads the root session's calls alone.

1. A subagent is a transcript Claude Code writes beside its parent, under the parent's session
   directory: `subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` for a Task or Agent call, and
   `subagents/workflows/<run>/agent-<id>.jsonl` for a workflow's agents. Every record in it is a
   sidechain carrying the parent's `sessionId`, and the parent's Agent result names the id
   ([the capture](captures/claude/subagent-transcript-shapes-2.1.281-macos.jsonl)). A file named
   `agent-<kind>-<id>` is a forked context, not a subagent: compaction, an aside question and a
   prompt suggestion replay the parent's context under the parent's own call ids, so reading them
   would count the parent's calls twice. A sidechain record inside the parent's own file is not read.
   A teammate of an agent team, which writes its own top-level transcript, and the older layout's
   `agent-*.jsonl` beside the project's sessions, are not read here; their checks count toward no
   session yet.
2. A subagent's checks count for the parent, read by the same parser and the same rules. A
   check's identity is still its directory and its segment, whoever ran it, so a check the parent
   and a subagent both ran is one check: its latest run counts, chosen by result time, and
   `earlier_failed` spans both. A failing subagent check is a failing check of the session, and a
   subagent's pass supports what a parent's would.
3. A subagent's entry is labelled in the record. The event and its published fact carry
   `worker_kind: "subagent"`, a key the fact already allows, on a check whose latest run was a
   subagent's and on a path a subagent wrote last. The parent's own entries carry none. The page
   renders no word for the key itself, so the evidence source line names the worker instead:
   "Claude subagent Bash call and paired result", "Claude subagent Edit call", and so on. The owner
   chose that wording on 2026-09-28 because the page already shows the source line and it needs no
   web change.
4. A subagent's writes count against the parent's earlier passes, with the same fields: a
   file-write tool's path, a check's own redirect, a fixer, and every changing shell command set
   `before_last_change`, `changed_after` and `last_changing_command_at` exactly as the parent's
   do. A parent write after a subagent's pass ages it the same way, and one subagent's write ages
   another's pass. A subagent working in another checkout still ages the parent's passes, as a write
   outside the working directory always has, and its written paths are relative to its own working
   directory.
5. One order across all of them. Each transcript keeps its own order, and the transcripts are
   merged by call time, the parent's first at a tie. The result time decides which run of a check
   is latest, across parent and subagent alike, as item 4 of the 2026-09-27 amendment set it; every
   change comparison keeps the call time, for the reason that amendment measured. A subagent run
   in the background beside its parent is ordered by its own records' times.
6. An Agent call is not itself a change. DRC-4709 named "an Agent call after a pass" because a
   subagent's work was unread; it is read now. The exposure left is a subagent whose transcript is
   not on this machine, whose writes Cargento cannot see.
7. The bound, amended 2026-09-30. One check-evidence scan spends at most
   `turn_scan_max_bytes` (normally 8 MiB) on the parent and all admitted children together. It
   charges actual binary bytes returned, including invalid records, discarded partial lines and a
   frozen cutoff search. A smaller explicit override, including zero, is honored. The parent reads
   first. Live children follow newest modification time, then stable session-relative path. A
   frozen moment reads children by stable session-relative path, replacing the earlier
   last-record-time ranking; today's mtime cannot reorder historical evidence. It searches each
   transcript forward to the first stamped record after the moment or the held file's end, using
   the same allowance and never rereading a discovered prefix. If the parent's cutoff is beyond
   that allowance, the frozen check read refuses. A child whose cutoff cannot be reached is unread.
   No historical packet is rewritten and no persisted scan manifest is needed for this rule.

   `subagent_transcripts_unread` counts admitted children with no readable work and valid plain
   hex IDs named by paired parent Agent or legacy Task results whose child work is unavailable.
   Repeated IDs count once, and a discovered unread file is not counted twice. A numeric
   `reads_from` horizon still marks passes older than a partial window or unread child's possible
   work. If a clipped live parent keeps a valid Agent result but loses its earlier call, that
   result does not increase the named-child count. Until its child can be read completely, it
   still makes held passes incomplete; the missing call cannot certify that delegated work was
   absent. Any valid named child that remains unavailable marks every held passing check
   `read_incomplete`, even if the parent passed later. A failed check that was actually read keeps
   its failure and High level. An incomplete pass cannot support a consistent outcome or the live
   "None or low" floor; incompleteness alone is not a departure. Collection, press and frozen check
   scans each get their own allowance. Activity, identity and user-message reads are separate, so
   this is not a bound on the entire frozen admission or validation operation.
8. Where it goes is unchanged. A subagent's checks are the parent session's record, so items 6, 7,
   9 and 10 apply to them as written, and a press carries a subagent check's tail only under the
   tool-output grant the parent's needs.

Measured on this machine on 2026-09-28, counts only: 9,443 agent files under 594 sessions'
`subagents` directories, 9,119 of them plain subagents, 234 compactions, 74 prompt suggestions
and 16 aside questions. Of the forked contexts that held a call, 15 of 16 aside questions and 21 of
39 compactions replayed the parent's own call ids; 245 of 245 sampled subagents shared none with
their parent, and 60 sampled sessions' subagents shared none with each other. In 150 sampled
sessions, all 1,107 agent ids an Agent result named had a transcript. 3,000 agent files, forks
included, held 41,205 Bash, 11,944 Edit and 2,903 Write calls. The largest session held 389
subagent transcripts totalling 405 MB, and the 95th percentile 69 and 23 MB.

## DEC-24: your intent is a drafted goal and a checklist, and a correction is yours to copy

Decided 2026-09-24 (DRC-4675). It brings the Session Drift Detection design's option C, "Unified
intent and drift panel", into the rulings. The panel is built by DRC-4680, the copied-correction
route by DRC-4678, Cancel by DRC-4693, Steer back by DRC-4681 and Update intent instead by
DRC-4697, among the milestone's other layers.

A reader who opens a session to see whether it drifted meets DRIFT, GOAL and EXPECTED OUTPUT, empty
fields, and a result that says "0 departures" beside "raised nothing and confirmed nothing". This
decides the words, the intent, the answer, when an analysis may run, and what Cargento may hand
back.

The owner ruled four things first. The goal is drafted from the reader's first prompt. The expected
outcome is a checklist the reader writes, and nothing is inferred for it. Copy, not Send. Claude
Code only: other harnesses show the panel with a stated limit. The drift level is its own decision,
[DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn).

The ruling is the full shape below. The two alternatives were the words and the checklist with no
correction, and today's shape unchanged. What it costs: amendments to DEC-15b's eligibility,
DEC-16, DEC-17 rules 6 and 7, DEC-20 (item 2, its control label and its primary-control paragraph),
DEC-21 item 1, SECURITY.md's reader-requested section (labels "Analyze drift" / "Allow and
analyze") and DEC-22; new stored items (a revision's window start, its outcome lines with each
line's source, a reading's `evidence_through`, a digest of each copied correction) and one new
token, a reader's "not accurate" mark; and reader edits inside a copied correction are exempt from
the later-direction floor (item 9).

1. Words. The panel is "Intent and drift": an "Intent" section (Goal, Expected outcome) and a
   "Drift" section. The action is "Analyze drift", replacing DEC-20's "Check for drift". Answers
   name departures, never "no drift": "Departs from your intent", "Can't tell", "Nothing found
   against what it read". The attempt count stays beside the control.
2. The goal draft. On a session with no saved goal, the goal field shows the reader's first prompt
   as Cargento publishes it (one line, a clipped excerpt marked as such), marked "from your
   prompt", unsaved. "Looks right" saves it; an edit saves it as typed; pressing Analyze drift
   adopts it in the same press (DEC-22). Nothing is inferred for the expected outcome. Amended
   2026-10-02 (owner): there is no "Looks right"; Save intent is enabled over the untouched draft
   and adopts it, so a drafted goal has one way to be saved, and Undo changes stays inert until
   there is an edit.
3. The checklist. The expected outcome is up to six lines the reader types, each at most 240
   characters and one line, each read and shown as its own constraint under DEC-17's rules. Each
   line records its source: typed, or added from entry #n. The bounds, fixed by DRC-4685, the layer
   that first stores and sends outcome lines:
   - The store holds 6 lines of at most 240 characters on each revision. A seventh line, or a line
     over 240 characters, is refused rather than clipped. The store's read limit is 16 MiB, and a
     write trims the least recently written entries until the file fits, so the next read reads
     what the write kept (owner, 2026-09-24). The entry being written is never the one trimmed:
     when it cannot fit even alone, nothing is written and the save answers `unwritable`.
   - The history copy is one flat field per line, at most 256 characters each, with a closed
     source token beside it and no entry id.
   - The goal and the lines take at most 9,216 of 16,384 bytes of the prompt. Over that share,
     every line is dropped together as not asked, never some of them.
   - The reply cap is 8,192 bytes, and a reply cut at the cap keeps each answer that arrived
     whole.
   - The annotation request body cap is 12,288 bytes. The widest body the page can send is a
     goal and six lines pasted as control characters, which the browser writes as six bytes each
     before the store collapses them: 10,238 bytes with a 64-character session id.
4. A later direction before an analysis. When the record holds an unsettled later direction of the
   reader's, the Drift section asks before the press, naming how many are unsettled. For one it
   says "You gave a later direction at #<n>: "<first line>"."; for several, "You gave <N> later
   directions since saving your intent, the earliest at #<n>: "<first line>"." Then it offers "Keep
   my intent and analyze" or "Add it to my intent". Keep settles all of them (DEC-16's "The
   baseline still applies") and analyzes in one press, and counts as "Allow" where the disclosure
   beside it has not been allowed yet. Add opens a new outcome line holding the direction's raw text
   for review. A direction over 240 characters or on several lines is edited by the reader to one
   line before saving, and never saved as a summary. When six lines exist, the reader replaces or
   merges an existing line, and a seventh line is refused with a sentence saying why. The goal is
   kept.
5. Background analysis. Analyze drift starts a job the server owns: a job id; phases that match
   real work ("Preparing what is sent", "Waiting for <provider>", "Checking the reply"), published
   over the existing push so a reload keeps them; and Cancel. The call runs in its own process
   group (a Job Object on Windows), so Cancel never signals the daemon's group. Cancel kills that
   group, releases the one-in-flight slot only after the child is reaped and its temporary files
   are removed, records a "cancelled" withheld reason as a spent attempt, and discards a reply that
   arrives after it. Amended 2026-09-24 (owner, DRC-4693): a cancel that lands before anything is
   reserved spends nothing. The hint under the button says what is read ("Reads the session up to
   <cutoff> against your intent. Runs in the background.") and carries the DEC-21 disclosure. The
   button reads "Allow and analyze" until allowed. Amended 2026-10-01 (owner, Q1, DRC-4758): the
   button reads "Analyze drift" in every state, and the first press that would send anything opens
   a consent step that shows the full disclosure, as the server's parts, before "Allow and
   analyze", with "Not now" beside it
   ([the consent step](#amended-2026-10-01-the-first-press-is-a-consent-step)).
6. The result. Per line: "Departs at #<n>" with its cited evidence, only for a valid departure. A
   consistent line names its source by the cited entry's type: "Consistent with #<n>, as the tool
   reported; not inspected" for a tool outcome, "Consistent with what the session said at #<n>; not
   a check" for the agent's own account, on the Goal only: on an outcome line the agent's own
   account yields `not verifiable` (DEC-17 rule 7). Changed by
   [DEC-17's amendment of 2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence),
   which says what a `consistent` resting on the agent's messages reads now. Never "Done" and
   never a check mark. Otherwise
   "Can't tell: nothing recorded shows this yet". A headline and short account render only under a departure,
   built from departure detail with its citations. "Where the work went" groups written paths by
   folder without a model. The session's activity flags each entry a departure cites ("Cited") and
   a later direction ("A later direction you gave"). A reading stores `evidence_through`, and it is
   stale when the intent revision or the evidence after that time changes: "Your intent changed
   after this analysis" or "New work since this analysis", each with "Analyze again".
   Amended 2026-10-01 (DRC-4758 fix round, the stored-reading word budget): in the Drift card's
   checklist the line in view names its source without the qualifier, "Consistent with #<n>" for a
   tool outcome and "Consistent with what the session said at #<n>" for the agent's own account.
   The whole sentence above, qualifier included, is the first line of that line's Evidence, and the
   tool qualifier stays in view once for the page in the activity record's footer ("Results are as
   the tool reported; not inspected."). Never "Done" and never a check mark still holds.
7. Steer back. The server composes a correction without a model, from these fields only: the goal,
   each outcome line with its state, and the cited entry numbers and times. No model prose, no tool
   output, and no recorded command as an instruction. It is editable before copying, at most 2,000
   characters, and offered from an analysis and, with no analysis, from the recorded facts (a
   failed check, a later direction). Copy only, and the panel uses Copy-only wording where the
   design had a Send hint. Sending it into the session is DEC-25, a follow-on that is not ruled
   (DRC-4698).
8. Update intent instead. It opens Intent for editing and offers the later direction as a new
   outcome line under item 4's rules. It never replaces the goal.
9. A copied correction coming back. The server records a digest of the exact text the reader
   copied, edited or not, per session: bounded per session, one use per digest, matched only after
   the copy. Each user message's digest is computed from its raw text before any clipping. A later
   message that matches exactly is Cargento-assisted: not adopted as the goal, not person-authored
   evidence, and not an unsettled later direction. No match, no special treatment. SECURITY.md
   names the route and its local-process residual. Built by DRC-4678 to the owner's rulings of
   2026-09-28: both sides normalise CRLF and CR to LF and a tab to four spaces and are trimmed at
   both ends, which is what a live paste into Claude Code 2.1.283 measured; eight digests per
   session, the oldest dropped; and the activity list labels a recognised message "You · Copied
   from Cargento". An edited paste, a backspace that wipes it included, is the reader's own words.
   The review round added three things. "After the copy" is a position in the transcript, not a
   clock: a message counts only if it was written past where the transcript ended when the text
   was copied. A recognised message is stored by its fact id and stays recognised after the tail
   moves on, up to 32 per session, apart from the eight waiting digests. Adoption and every
   surface that shows a prompt as the reader's words (the stated goal, the assignment, an exact
   direction) compare fact ids, so a prompt typed in the same second as a paste stays the
   reader's while the tail holds it.
10. Not accurate. A token the reader can set on a reading, stored with the annotation entry and
    removed with it. `--forget` does not reach it. It is never sent, never counted and never entered
    into abstention marks, and SECURITY.md notes it.
11. Numbering. The activity list numbers entries in the evidence window, and a citation says
    "#<n>". It says "turn" only where the harness supplies a stable turn identity. Stored readings
    cite fact ids, so a number is recomputed, never stored.
12. The unasked lane receives none of this: no outcome lines, no work evidence, no drafted or
    confirmed goal, no correction, no digest and no Not accurate token. None of them makes a
    session eligible for the lane, or triggers, orders or gates it.
13. When an analysis may read, and against what. A session waiting at its prompt after a turn stop
    may be read through its last turn, saying so, and never as a reading of how it ended; a goal
    saved after the stop does not withhold it. The evidence window starts at the words' own time:
    the source time for adopted words (DEC-22); for typed words, the time of the latest
    person-authored message at or before the save, else the save time. It is stored on the revision
    beside the save time, as a new revision field admitted under DEC-15b, and a build that does not
    know it falls back to the save time. The page shows both times and labels work before the save
    as "from the last turn". The unasked lane still withholds at a turn stop.
14. The answer reducer. Any valid departure gives "Departs from your intent", and other lines keep
    their own state. Otherwise any saved constraint without a valid `departure` or `consistent`,
    including a malformed or missing result and a line the reading could not ask, gives "Can't
    tell". Otherwise the answer is "Nothing found against what it read. This is not a check that the
    work was done." A failed check in the window outranks both "Nothing found" and "Can't tell". A
    departure count renders only beside a departure. "No reading was produced" and the refusals are
    process states, never answers. All of it is session-page only: never on a row, a total or a
    notification. Elsewhere than Claude Code the panel states the harness limit ("Cargento can't
    read work from this harness"). "Stop session" is not offered (DEC-16, SECURITY.md).

### What the last-turn build decided, 2026-09-24

DRC-4679 built item 13. These are the calls the ruling left open, each made by the orchestrator
within the milestone's scope and recorded on the issue.

- Only Claude Code is read at a turn stop. `eligibility` takes an `admit_turn_stop` switch that is
  off by default, and only the reading route turns it on, for a harness in
  `reading.TURN_STOP_HARNESSES`. The unasked lane fires on every working-to-idle change, which is
  every turn stop, so it keeps the closed default. The test for that runs the lane with the real
  `reading.produce` and a model that counts its calls, because a lane test built on a fake producer
  cannot see the gate.
- A turn stop gets the same eight-second settle as a session end, with its own sentence, since the
  end's sentence says the session ended.
- Through the last turn means through the observed stop: the reading drops every entry timed after
  the stop (`reading.observed_stop`). A resumed turn whose state update lags leaves the row idle at the old stop while the
  record moves on, and without the cap a check from the new turn was cited in a reading that said it
  covered the last one.
- Words typed after a session end are still withheld. Only the turn stop is relaxed, and the
  withholding test still compares the save time, `baseline_at`. The window start moves only the
  evidence.
- The window start is recomputed on every save, a lines-only save included. For typed words it is
  the latest `user_message` of this session at or before the save, read on the server from the
  session's record, found in the all-sessions collection so a save from that view on an aged session
  still finds it. A permission approval is not a message, so it never moves the window. A record
  that cannot be read opens the window at the save and never refuses the save. Adopted words,
  including an adopted goal carried under a lines-only save, open at their source time.
- A stored window start that is not a moment at or before its own save refuses the entry, as a bad
  provenance does, because reading around it could restore older words.
- A check keeps its call time. The window start alone fixes the case the live walk found: none of
  22 recorded Bash calls had a message from the reader between the call and its result. Using the
  result time would move layer 1's published timestamps, so it is filed separately.
- The page reads the window from the reading, and derives it the old way for a reading stored
  without one. It labels work "from the last turn" only on a Claude Code session waiting at its
  prompt, and only the observed last turn inside the window: from the reader's latest message at or
  before the stop (or the window start, if later) up to the stop, never on the reader's own messages.
  The first build labelled from the window start to the save. That range is fixed at the save, so
  the next turn made it name an older one, and a save made mid-turn left the rest of that turn
  unlabelled.
- The hint says what an analysis reads: "Reads the session up to <cutoff> against your intent.",
  where the cutoff is now, its end, or its last turn, from the same end kind HOW IT LANDED shows. It
  shows only where a press could read: a provider, no refusal beside it, saved words, and words
  given before any observed end. The background job (DRC-4686) added "Runs in the background."
  after it.
- The later-direction floor stays at the save time. By construction no message of the reader's lies
  between the window start and the save, so moving it would change nothing on consistent data and
  would, on a fetch the server missed, turn a message into a later direction.

#### Amended 2026-10-02 (owner): Claude Code's transcript may show the turn stop

On a board no Claude Code hook reaches, no turn stop was ever observed, so Analyze drift opened
only while a write kept the row Working and closed 90 seconds after the last one. That covers a
dashboard on any port but the hooks' (4553 by default), every stop from before a restart, since
the coordinator holds stops in memory, and an `away_summary` that turned an idle row Working.
The owner's walk on 2026-10-02 saw Analyze go inert, live and inert again with no word why
(arbiter spec, `ui3`). Item 13 now admits a second kind of turn stop, for Claude Code alone:
the transcript's own top-level `stop_hook_summary` for this session, written when Claude Code
runs its Stop hooks, directly after the turn's last assistant reply, and with no `user` or
`assistant` record and no other activity newer than it by more than the activity grace. A
`user` record between that reply and the summary refuses it: a Stop hook that blocks the stop,
and a goal check that is not met, write their feedback as an `isMeta` user record there, then
the summary with `preventedContinuation` false, and the turn goes on. `preventedContinuation`
true is a hook ending the turn, and is a stop. The first build read that flag the other way
round and published a turn a hook kept going as finished (verifier S1, `ui3`, read from Claude
Code 2.1.287's own Stop-hook loop); the scorer's `_transcript_stop` shared the error and takes
the same correction, which is what its 2026-10-01 words "did not keep the turn going" meant. It is the record
the 2026-10-01 amendment measured about 115 ms ahead of the hook. It is read from the tail the
collector already reads and published as `turn_end_at`, and the row turns Idle as a hook Stop
would turn it. `finished_at` stays hook-only. A hook stop, when held, is the stop. Either kind
settles `reading_settle_sec` after its stamp, a reading through it drops every entry timed after
it, and its scope sentence says which kind it rested on. A last record that is a tool call, a
tool result, an interruption or a command is not a turn stop. Neither is a summary labelled for
any hooks but Stop: Claude Code 2.1.287's Stop path writes no `hookLabel`, and its own reader
knows a summary labelled `PreToolUse`, written mid-turn after a tool call and before the tool
runs, so only an absent label or `Stop` is admitted (verifier S2, `ui3`, read from the installed
bundle). No capture under `docs/captures/` records the label, and the test fixtures carry one only
where a test sets it. The press withholds a non-stop with Claude Code's own sentence. The unasked
lane still withholds at every turn stop, and no other harness changes. One thing does change for
it, on a board no hook reaches: a quick turn's row now changes state twice, Working to Idle at its
stop and back at the next prompt, where before it read Working throughout, and the lane, which
considers a typed-goal row whenever its state changes, may read it mid-flight at each return to
Working (verifier S3). That is what a hooked board already does, and the lane's own bounds hold
it: off by default, at most three readings per session, twelve a day, and 900 seconds apart
(`unasked_session_cap`, `unasked_daily_cap`, `unasked_session_floor_sec`). The final assistant message's `stop_reason` is not read: no capture records
it. This does not change the scorer's rule of 2026-10-01, which vouches for a recorded case
only at a matched stamp, and it infers nothing from the last assistant message.

### What the background build decided, 2026-09-24

DRC-4686 built the background half of item 5; Cancel is DRC-4693. The owner's calls are on the
issue, and the rest were made within them.

- The press answers `202` with the job before the model is called. Every refusal the press had
  before stays synchronous and first. A second press answers `409` with the running job and starts
  nothing; `409` rather than `200`, because a forged press is read by its status.
- The job registry sits beside the one-in-flight slot in `reading`, under its lock, rather than
  replacing it. The unasked lane takes the same slot, and with the slot replaced it would either lose
  its guard or appear as a job the reader never started. A press that meets the lane's slot answers
  `409` with no job.
- The job is published board-wide as `reading_jobs`, keyed as the page keys a session, and not as a
  field on every row. A row field would be declared in three places and would enter history.
- Each phase begins at a real point: preparing at the press, waiting at the CLI's spawn (after the
  spend is committed), checking when a reply arrived. A withheld gate ends a job while it prepares
  and a failed call ends it while it waits; nothing publishes a phase that did not happen. The
  design's timed steps and its "Analyzing 38 turns" heading are overruled: the heading reads
  "Analyzing drift", because a Claude Code session has no stable turn identity (item 11).
- The store is written first, then the job is removed and the slot freed as one step, then one
  revision is published. Any other order lets a page show a finished box with no result, or a result
  under a running box.
- The permission and budget are read again at the model seam inside the job. A refusal there ends
  the job with nothing written, and the board's published permission already says why.
- A job lost to a restart is recorded, not dropped. A marker written before the reservation becomes
  a spent `interrupted` attempt at the next start, so the count stays equal to what the budget
  charged. Letting it vanish was the alternative, and it leaves a charged attempt nowhere in the
  count. Written before rather than after, because a marker that fails after the spend leaves the
  spend uncounted. The cost was that a dashboard dying between the marker and the reservation
  counted one attempt the budget never charged. The job ledger replaced that trade-off on
  2026-09-27 (see "What the accounting build decided" below).
- One job is one attempt. The outcome is stored under the job's id and a second write for that id
  counts nothing, and a marker is claimed by an atomic rename before it is recovered. The review
  measured a double count in up to 36 of 40 runs when the dashboard died between the write and the
  marker's removal; reordering alone would have traded it for a lost count.
- A marker's pid means a running dashboard only when a state file on this state directory names it,
  and this process's own pid means an earlier run: a container's dashboard is PID 1 on every start,
  and a bare liveness check never recovered its markers.
- A graceful stop records `interrupted` too. The shutdown kills the call before the next start can
  find its marker, so without this the job wrote "did not complete" for what was a stop.
- Every model call, the goal lane's and the unasked lane's included, uses the supervised runner. A
  timeout that kills only the direct child leaks the grandchild, which those lanes had too.
- Shutdown kills every supervised group, because a child in its own group no longer receives the
  terminal's signals. Leaving that to Cancel would have left one layer of the stack with a child
  that outlives the daemon. SIGHUP and SIGQUIT unwind through the same cleanup as SIGTERM, since a
  closed terminal otherwise left the CLI running untimed, and the shutdown closes the runner under
  its spawn lock, since a CLI spawned during the teardown was measured outliving it. A SIGHUP or
  SIGQUIT the server inherited as ignored stays ignored, or `nohup` would stop protecting it;
  SIGTERM always gets the handler, so `kill <pid>` stops the server as it did before. A reading not yet
  sent when the runner closes is refused before the reservation, so a stop never charges for it.
- On POSIX the group is signalled only while its leader is unreaped: the exit is watched without
  reaping (`waitid` with `WNOWAIT`, a kqueue exit filter on macOS, which has no `waitid`), the group
  is swept, and only then is the leader reaped, with the end of signalling marked in the same step
  under the group's lock. A group id signalled after the reap could name a stranger's group. kqueue
  reports a registration error as an event, so only ESRCH there counts as an exit; any other error
  leaves the exit unwatchable, and the call then polls rather than reading it as an exit and killing
  a running CLI. A helper that leaves the group is not reached, and the docs say so.
- A spent outcome the store refuses keeps its marker, marked as refused, and the next start records
  that the analysis ran and its outcome could not be stored, not that Cargento stopped. A refused
  "interrupted" or "unstopped" keeps its own reason, so "may still be running" is never turned
  into "ran".
- A finished step is a filled mark and never a check mark. Item 6's rule is about results, but a
  check shape beside a reading is close enough to its reason that the design's check circle was
  not copied.

#### Amended 2026-10-01: a press the board says cannot read starts no job

DRC-4758 (slice A2). A walk on a board no hook reached found the press offered, a `202` job started,
and the reason it then withheld landing far below the button. The press-time withholds are now
decided once, before any job, by `reading.press_eligibility`, and the board publishes the same
answer on every row as `reading_eligibility: {ok, reason, until}`. None there means not computed
(annotations off), which is not the same reading as `ok: false`.

- The tokens it can publish are named in `reading.PRESS_WITHHELD`: `idle-unknown`, `unobservable`,
  `turn-stop`, `settling`, `stop-settling` and `revision-after-end`. Each is a fact the collection
  already holds about how the row ended. `until` is set for the two settling tokens, as the stop or
  end plus `reading_settle_sec`.
- Every other withheld token stays a job outcome. `record-unread` and `no-record-reader` need the
  observed record, which is a transcript read the collection must not make per row per poll, so
  `record_withheld` is left out. Consent, the budget, the CLI and the ledger are read where they
  were. `nothing-typed` and `discarded` are left out because a press over a draft adopts it first.
- An ineligible press answers `200` with `reason: "withheld"`, the token, its `WITHHELD` sentence
  and `until`. It registers no job, writes no outcome and counts no attempt. An Allow it carried is
  still recorded. This replaces the `202` such a press used to get, the first bullet above, for these
  tokens only.
- The page, the press check and the job read one function with the same `admit_turn_stop`, so they
  agree by construction. A test holds the job's pre-model withhold to the published one over a
  table of rows that reaches every token.
- Cost, measured on `bench_collect --simulate claude=40`: 0.05 ms for 40 rows against a 33 ms
  collect, under the 5% bar the plan set.

#### Amended 2026-10-01: a press says beside the button what it can do

DRC-4758 (slice B). The owner's walk pressed "Analyze drift" on a session the board could only
withhold: the box flashed, the panel went back to the bare button, and the reason sat in the READING
section below the fold.

- Where the row publishes `reading_eligibility.ok: false`, "Analyze drift" is inert
  (`aria-disabled`, never the stage's primary) and no Allow step is offered: the handler refuses on
  the same reason before it would ask, per
  [NUI-18](design-next-ui.md#nui-18-one-control-primitive-and-an-inert-control-stays-on-the-page).
  Directly under the button's row is one page-owned line keyed by the token
  (`NEXT_READING_PRESS_LINES`, one per `reading.PRESS_WITHHELD` token, each 12 words or fewer, walked
  by a test), and the server's own `WITHHELD` sentence, published beside the token as
  `reading_eligibility.sentence`, is under "Why it can't read". A Codex row between turns says
  "Codex sessions can be analyzed only while a turn is running." (owner Q8, 2026-10-01: Claude Code
  first). A Codex row whose turn is running is published eligible and can be pressed.
- A settling row is inert until `until`, read at render and at the press. No timer is added; the
  next collection drops the token.
- A row with no published eligibility (annotations off, or an older payload) offers the press and
  the server decides. A `200` withheld reply is held as that press's answer until the row publishes
  its own, so the inert line stands beside the button at once.
- Every account of a press sits directly under the button's row, before the hint and the
  disclosure: the refusal, this tab's last answer (including "Could not confirm the reading"), and
  a stored withhold as "Last analysis, 3m ago: <sentence>", aged from `reading_withheld_at`. The
  READING section no longer repeats the withheld sentence.

#### Amended 2026-10-02 (owner): a press shows it is working, and Analyze says when it opens or closes

The owner typed a goal and two outcome lines and pressed Save intent: "Nothing happened for a
couple seconds and then the page updated." Measured on the scratch board, the POST took about
900 ms and the first change to the page came at about 1.3 s, with Save intent a live button
throughout (arbiter spec, `ui3`).

- Save intent shows it is working. At the press it is `aria-disabled` and `aria-busy` (never
  `disabled`, which drops focus), with a spinner and "Saving…" drawn over its idle label, which
  stays as an invisible ghost so the control keeps its width. A second press, and a keystroke that
  would re-arm it, do nothing until it is answered. While it is pending the Drift line reads
  "Saving your intent…" rather than telling the reader to save it. The start is said to the polite
  region only when the request is still open after 400 ms, and the outcome only once the refresh
  has drawn it. A request with no answer is aborted at 15 s and the control comes back with
  "Cargento did not answer, so this page cannot tell whether your intent was saved", never "Not
  saved", unless the refresh shows a newer revision holding exactly what was sent, which is the
  save. A 5 s backstop after the bound clears the busy state whatever the fetch did. The state is
  held by the control's focus key (`docs/design-reader-state.md`), and only the press that started
  an entry ends it, so a handler the backstop outlived cannot end a newer press's (verifier R2).
  Undo changes is inert while its save is in flight, on a redraw and on a keystroke alike, and a
  press on it does nothing, so the words being sent stay in the box (measured in Chrome, ui4).
  Escape in the goal or lines box is the same undo and does nothing then either (verifier V1).
- The Analyze family does the same. Analyze drift and Analyze again read "Starting…" with a
  spinner, solid and never hatched, until the Analyzing box is drawn. On Allow and analyze the
  question stays on screen with Allow reading "Starting…" and Not now inert, because the card is
  the consent; it closes on the answer. Keep reads "Keeping…" until its last request and refresh,
  and Cancel reads "Cancelling…" until the server accepts or answers that the job is not running.
  A lost request comes back with the control's existing sentence, so nothing stays busy forever.
- An inert Analyze says something true and actionable. No line says Analyze opens "once this
  session finishes a turn", which was false of a turn that had finished where Cargento could not
  see it. Beside an idle row with no end: a Claude Code session reads "This session's last turn
  isn't recorded as finished.", Codex keeps its own line, another harness reads "Analyze opens
  while this session runs." (or "…or once it ends." where its events reach the board), and a
  scan-only one reads "This harness sends no events, so Analyze opens only while it runs." The
  Why under it is `reading.withheld_sentence`, per harness, which names the How to use section
  that makes a board live; `WITHHELD` stays the job-time and stored sentence. A settling row's
  Why says Analyze opens by itself.
- No silent flips. When Analyze opens or closes with no press of the reader's, one short line under
  the button row says so ("Analyze is open again: the session is running.", "Analyze is open: the
  session's last turn finished.", "Analyze is open: the session ended.", "Analyze closed: the
  session went quiet.", or "Analyze closed: your intent was saved after the session
  ended."), drawn without a role and written once to the polite region, at most once a minute per
  session. A flip inside that minute is held, not dropped, and the newest is said when the minute
  is up, unless the region's last word is already the state the card shows (verifier F4). The
  close says "went quiet" rather than "stopped running", because a turn left on an open tool call
  or an interruption did not stop (verifier F5). Opening is drawn at once. Closing waits until the inert state has held for two
  payloads and ten seconds, so a session that pauses between turns, whose stop settles for eight,
  never closes it. A consent question Analyze closes under is withdrawn, "Analyze closed before
  you answered, so nothing was sent.", and never raised again without a press. A settling row
  draws a waiting dot beside "Ready in a few seconds." and opens at `until` with no new data, so
  this supersedes "No timer is added" in the 2026-10-01 press amendment: one page-wide timer
  serves the one drawn card, never a row. Levels and a scope change are not announced.
- A mid-flight analysis never looks final. On a running session the hint reads "Reads the work so
  far; the session is still running.", the Analyzing box says "Reads only the work so far.", and a
  stored reading whose scope is mid-flight leads its answer with "So far:".

#### Amended 2026-10-01: the first press is a consent step

Owner ruling Q1, 2026-10-01 (DRC-4758 slice B). The first press asked its question by relabelling the
button "Allow and analyze" and moving it below the whole ~180-word disclosure, so the owner's walk
read it as a press that did nothing.

- The press that needs an Allow replaces the button's slot with a bordered step: the question "Send
  this session to <receiver> for analysis?", the disclosure as `route.disclosure_parts`, a short
  list in the server's order and unreworded and never inside a disclosure, then "Allow and analyze"
  (the stage's one primary) and "Not now". The parts join to the whole disclosure (a server test
  holds `" ".join(parts) == disclosure`), so DEC-21 item 1 and the account-details condition in
  SECURITY.md still hold before the consenting press.
- "Not now" sends, allows and records nothing, and brings the idle button back.
- The question takes the press's focus key, as the analyzing box's title does, so focus lands on
  it and a second Enter or the rest of a double-click cannot give consent unread. Allow carries
  `reading-allow:<key>`; Not now carries `reading-not-now:<key>` and falls back to the press's key.
- The step comes back whenever an Allow is needed again, such as a new tool-output destination
  or, since the owner's binding of 2026-10-02, a new destination for the words, when it opens
  with the server's line saying so
  ([the binding](#amended-2026-10-02-owner-the-allow-is-bound-to-where-the-words-go)).

#### Amended 2026-10-01: idle, the disclosure is one worded click away

Owner ruling Q1, 2026-10-01 (DRC-4758 slice B). This supersedes the panel build's "Idle, the button
comes first and the DEC-21 disclosure follows it with the hint" for the idle stage.

- Idle, the order is the button, with the attempt count on its row ("0 requests" to the eye, the
  whole "0 model requests recorded for this session." to a screen reader), any account of a press,
  the one hint line, then the DEC-21 disclosure under a closed summary: "What is sent to
  <receiver>" until that receiver is allowed, and always while the route is a fallback, then "What
  is sent". The button stays described by the disclosure's paragraph. Turn off readings sits inside
  the summary, still on the page. Amended 2026-10-02 (NU-9): the count is a line of its own directly
  under the button row, ahead of any account of a press, because on the row it pushed "Analyze
  again" onto a second one beside Steer back and Update intent instead, which are now one row of
  the same secondary style after the primary. It reads "N model requests" in every state (idle,
  confirming, analyzing and stored), keeps the whole sentence for a screen reader, and is not drawn
  under an inert Analyze, which no press can spend. "Not accurate?" is the quiet button primitive.
- Idle sends nothing, so nothing is sent before the receiver is named. A press owed an Allow opens
  [the consent step](#amended-2026-10-01-the-first-press-is-a-consent-step), which shows the whole
  disclosure before "Allow and analyze". A press under an Allow already given sends at once, and
  the receiver it reaches was named either by that step or, on a fallback route, by the summary in
  view beside the button. An Allow given on another harness's session lets a fallback press reach
  its second provider with no step of its own, which is why that summary keeps the receiver's
  name. DEC-21 item 4 holds that way (fix round, 2026-10-01).
- While analyzing, the box stands alone with the count after it; the disclosure is not drawn,
  because the job sends nothing more.
- The summary's open state survives a redraw through `nextCockpitDisclosureAttr`, keyed by session,
  under the existing reader-state row for tier-2 caveat bodies.

#### Amended 2026-10-02 (owner): the disclosure is a short list

The owner, 2026-10-02: the disclosure "is long and arduous to read. The text should be clear and to
the point, stop overusing prose." It was 128 words for a Codex session, 239 for a Claude Code
session read by Claude Code and 202 for one read by Codex. It is now a list of one-line items, the
route's own `disclosure_parts`, still joined to `disclosure` by a single space. The first list was
75, 148 and 121 words for those three routes, in 5, 7 and 6 items, and verifier V2 found the Claude
Code one still repeating itself: the destination twice, the redaction twice, and "Claude Code reads
this Claude Code session." under a summary that names Claude Code. It is now 61, 120 and 101 words
in 4, 6 and 5 items, each said once:

1. The route's note: whose harness reads this session, and why when it is a fallback. On the
   session's own harness it reads "This session's own harness reads it."
2. `Sent:` the goal and a bounded set of the session's entries, with the reader's messages up to
   1,000 characters each. On Pi it adds the expected outcome lines when a work result is among
   them; on a harness with no work evidence the lines are never sent, so it says nothing of them.
3. On a route whose record lists checks, tool output only after it is allowed: the command,
   result and last 180 characters of output as printed, the paths written, and the expected
   outcome lines, which go only beside a check; or that none of it is sent where the destination
   cannot be named.
4. `To:` where the words go as `reading_route.destination` names it, with credential shapes
   redacted, through the provider's own CLI and sign-in, spending the reader's capacity: the
   company off this machine, or the cloud or base-URL host configured in its place, or, where
   nothing can be named, that Cargento cannot name it. It follows everything it covers, tool
   output included, so it alone says where all of it goes. Until verifier C1 (2026-10-02) this
   item named the company whatever the environment said, so under Bedrock, a base URL or a unix
   socket the reader allowed one receiver and the words went to another.
5. On a Claude Code route, what its CLI adds: the working directory, platform, shell, OS version,
   date and device identifier, and under a Claude account sign-in the email address and account
   ID, which is the 2026-09-27 condition.
6. The caveat, last: a reading is a model's account of the evidence, never a verification.

Changed on 2026-10-03 by
[the agent's own words amendment](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence) and
its review. On a Claude Code session item 2 reads "with your messages and the agent's messages up
to 1,000 characters each, and your expected outcome lines": the lines go with the agent's messages,
not only beside a check. Item 3 no longer names the outcome lines, and both its forms say the
agent's messages may quote tool output. The Claude Code routes are now 129 and 110 words, and the
Codex route is unchanged at 61.

What was cut repeats another item or explains a mechanism: "a subprocess", "uses its own
authentication", "one of the paths that sends session content off this machine" (now `off this
machine`), and how a long record shortens the oldest messages, which sends less rather than more.
The [whole-message amendment](#amended-2026-10-01-a-reading-sees-the-readers-whole-message) said
the disclosure states that last point; it no longer does. The consent step still shows every item
before "Allow and analyze", and a test holds each fact listed above, a word budget per route, and
that no item repeats another. In the popover the paragraph under the list says only what a reading
reads ("What it reads is the evidence on this page …"), because the list has just said what a
reading is.

Idle, "What is sent to <receiver>" (or "What is sent") opens the same list as a popover, the
system the header's "Why" uses ([NUI-19](design-next-ui.md#nui-19-a-caveat-has-three-tiers)), in
place of the accordion the [idle amendment](#amended-2026-10-01-idle-the-disclosure-is-one-worded-click-away)
drew. Analyze drift stays described by the list, and Turn off readings stays inside it.

### What the Cancel build decided, 2026-09-24

DRC-4693 built Cancel, the rest of item 5. The owner ruled the spend, the unconfirmed kill and the
new strings on the issue; the other calls were made within them.

- Where the cancel lands decides the spend, and the line is the reservation itself: the job takes a
  commit point under the lock a cancel takes, immediately before it reserves. A cancel accepted
  before that point is unspent, reserves nothing and spawns nothing, and the stored
  sentence is "The analysis was cancelled before anything was sent. Nothing was sent or spent." From
  the reservation on it is spent with no refund, whether the call was still to be spawned, running,
  or had already replied: whether the provider billed a killed call is unknowable, and a refund
  would make press-then-cancel a loop around the cap. That sentence is "The analysis was cancelled
  before it finished. Nothing is shown from it, the attempt still counts, and a fresh press is the
  only retry." It says "nothing is shown", not "nothing was produced", because a reply may have
  arrived and been discarded, and it never says "you cancelled", because a forged local cancel reads
  the same. Counting every cancel as spent was the simpler alternative, rejected because it records
  a charge the budget never made. The first build checked the flag and then reserved, so a cancel
  landing in between was charged (review F1); the commit point closes that gap.
- The flag and the handle are read under the flight lock, by the cancel and by the spawn's handover
  alike, so a cancel that lands between the spawn and the handover is seen by one of them. Without
  that, a cancel in that gap found no process to kill and the CLI ran to completion.
- The route never waits for the reap. It sets the flag and kills without blocking; the call's own
  wait looks up every 0.1 s, then kills and reaps with the 5 s bound. A kill that cannot be
  confirmed in that bound records `unstopped` ("may still be running") and frees the slot, as the
  timeout and shutdown paths do. That departs from "only after the child is reaped"; a slot held
  forever would answer every later press `in-flight` until a restart.
- The outcome is decided at a seal just before the write. A cancel before it wins over whatever came
  back; a cancel after it answers `not-running` and changes nothing, because the result is already
  being stored. A cancelled job never lights "Checking the reply".
- Precedence: `unstopped` first, then the stop's own word (`interrupted`, or `stopping` when nothing
  was sent) over a cancel made after the shutdown began, then the cancel over a failed or finished
  call. The stop's word stands only where the stop reached the call first. A shutdown that begins
  just after the model seam's own `closed()` check, followed by a cancel before the commit point,
  records `cancelled-unsent`. Nothing was reserved, so the count still equals the charge. (Amended
  2026-09-27: with no cancel that job now records an unspent `stopping` too, because the
  reservation finds the runner shut; see "What the accounting build decided" below. Before that it
  reserved and recorded a spent `interrupted`.)
- `cancelled` is a kept marker reason, so a store that refuses it never recovers as "The analysis
  ran", and the cancel writes that reason into the marker, so a dashboard that dies before the
  write records the cancel at its next start.
- Its own route, `POST /api/reading/cancel`, naming the job id, rather than a field on the reading
  route. A stale tab cannot cancel a newer press, and no job, another job's id and an unknown
  session answer one `409 not-running` body.
- A job leaves the board only after its outcome is stored, and a collection samples the job
  registry before it reads the store, so one collection shows the job or its outcome and never
  neither. The job's final publish clears the snapshot under the collect lock, so a collection that
  was already running, and read the store before the write, cannot stand as the fresh snapshot
  afterwards. The live walk measured that stale body for about the snapshot floor: no box, the
  previous sentence and the previous count.
- On the page, Cancel sits in the box's header row. The press button's focus key moves to the box's
  title (`tabindex="-1"`), not to Cancel, because a keyboard press followed by a second Enter on
  Cancel cancelled the analysis it had just started, a spent attempt. Cancel has its own key and a
  fallback to the press, so focus lands on the press when the box goes. While a
  cancel finishes it keeps its label and is disabled, driven by the published `cancelling` flag so a
  reload draws the same. A lost answer says "Could not confirm the cancel. The analysis may still be
  running; refresh to check." The design goes straight back to idle with no sentence; the stored
  sentence is the ruling's addition.
- "Turn off readings" does not cancel a running job in this layer: a withdrawal after the spawn does
  not stop a call already sent, and that is a separate decision.

### What the accounting build decided, 2026-09-27

DRC-4712, DRC-4713 and DRC-4667 made the count equal the charge on the paths the two builds above
left open. The owner ruled the stop's line, the ledger, the oversized token and its sentence, and
the poll-fallback limit on DRC-4713.

- The stop's line is the reservation, the same as the Cancel's. The reservation's insert and
  commit run under the lock `supervise.kill_all` takes, after SQLite's write lock is held, so a
  shutdown lands wholly before the charge or wholly after it. Before it, nothing is written, the
  seam answers as the stop it was, and the stored sentence is `stopping` ("Nothing was sent or
  spent"). After it, the attempt is spent and records `interrupted`, even when nothing had been
  spawned yet, as a cancel after the reservation is. The seam's early `closed()` look stays as the
  cheap path. The first build charged a shutdown that landed between that look and the reservation
  and then refused to spawn: one attempt counted for a call never sent. A refund on a certain
  non-send was the alternative, rejected because it would be the first refund path and would treat
  the stop and the cancel differently.
- A job ledger replaces the recovery trade-off. The reservation commits the job's id in a
  `spend_jobs` table in the same transaction as the charge, so no crash point separates them. It is
  a table and not a column on `spends`, because an older build's `INSERT INTO spends VALUES (?)`
  fails against a second column, and after a rollback every press would be refused. Rows are kept
  for 30 days, far past the budget's day, so a restart long after a crash still finds its row. A
  marker says it came from a build that reserves under the job's id. Recovery counts that marker's
  attempt as spent only when the ledger holds a charge for the id. When the ledger holds none, the
  marker recovers unspent, as `stopping`, or as `cancelled-unsent` when the marker says cancelled.
  When the ledger cannot answer (no store, no SQLite, a store from before the ledger, a marker older
  than the rows kept, or a marker from a build without the ledger), the attempt counts as spent, as
  it always did, because dropping a charged attempt is the loss Q2 ruled out. Rewriting the marker
  after the charge was the alternative, and it only moves the window: a death between the commit
  and the rewrite leaves a charged attempt uncounted.
- An output file past 1 MiB stops the call. The wait looks at the output file's size every
  0.01 s while the CLI runs, and once more after the group or Job Object has no live writer
  (DRC-4729). Watched POSIX cleanup keeps the leader unreaped while it observes group states;
  Windows waits for the Job Object's active-process count to reach zero. An uncertain or timed-out
  observation refuses the reply. The documented poll fallback cannot prove this quiescence. Past `observer.OUTPUT_FILE_LIMIT_BYTES` it kills the CLI's group or Job Object the way a
  Cancel does. The slice was 0.1 s in the first build, and an unpaused writer put 286 to 600 MiB on
  disk before the first look; at 0.01 s it measured 41 to 89 MiB. A CLI that wrote past the bound
  and exited inside one slice first read as an ordinary reply, which the look after the exit
  closes. The goal lane falls back on an oversized call as on any failure and records nothing. The outcome is a spent `oversized` attempt ("The reading was stopped because its CLI
  wrote far more output than a reading can use. Nothing was produced, the attempt still counts, and
  a fresh press is the only retry."), and `oversized` is a kept marker reason, so a store that
  refuses it never recovers as "ran". The bound is deliberately far above the 8 KiB read cap, since
  a reply past the read cap is salvaged as cut rather than failed. `RLIMIT_FSIZE` was rejected
  because it applies to every file the CLI writes, its own logs included, and has no Windows
  equivalent.
- The poll fallback's limit is documented, not fixed. When neither `waitid` nor kqueue can
  watch an exit, the call polls, and the poll reaps the leader, so helpers left in its group after
  a normal exit are not swept. A timeout, a shutdown or a Cancel still kills the group first. It has
  been seen only under forced errors, and a test pins it so the documents change if it does. On
  that path a helper still writing after the leader's exit is not reached either, whether it was
  already writing under the bound or starts afterwards, since the poll that sees the exit is the
  reap. The size is looked at before each poll, so a writer caught
  while the leader runs is killed with its group. Seeing the exit without reaping would need a third
  watcher (libc `waitid` with `WNOWAIT` through ctypes on macOS, measured working), which is the
  fix this ruling declined.
- The ledger answers "no charge" only for a job that started after its watermark. The watermark is
  the ledger's creation time, raised to 30 days back on every prune, so a row pruned under a clock
  that ran ahead and was then set back, or a store deleted and made again after the crash, reads as
  "cannot say" and the attempt counts. Without it, the first review measured a charged attempt
  recovering as unspent after a prune at a later wall clock. A row that exists answers "charged"
  whatever its age.
- Precedence among the spent words: `unstopped` > `cancelled` > `oversized` > `interrupted`. "May
  still be running" is the one sentence nothing hides. A cancel before the seal still becomes the
  cancel, as it does over a finished reply. A shutdown after a flood kill keeps `oversized`,
  because that kill came first and the file did pass the bound. All four are spent, so the order
  never moves the count. The owner accepted it on 2026-09-27.
- On Windows the prompt is fed from a thread, and the call waits with `process.wait`. CPython's
  Windows `communicate` writes stdin on the calling thread before any timed wait, so a CLI that
  never read a prompt larger than the pipe held the call past its own timeout.

### What the panel build decided, 2026-09-24

DRC-4680 built items 1 and 14 on the session page: the Intent and drift panel beside the session's
activity. The owner ruled the first three calls below on the issue; the orchestrator made the rest on
the analysis's recommendation.

- The harness limit replaces only the level and meter. "Cargento can't read work from this harness"
  stands in the level's slot on every harness except Claude Code and Pi, and `Analyze drift` stays
  wherever the route names a reader, because DEC-21 item 4 still lets Codex read a Codex session.
  Never on Pi, whose work results are read, so the sentence would be false there. The observed
  record's old line "Cargento reads those on Pi alone" is retired for the same reason: Claude Code's
  checks are read too.
- On Antigravity the limit stays true because only the person's typed directions are read, never
  its work (owner, 2026-09-27, DRC-4689). Those directions give a pressed reading something to read
  against. They do not give item 2's goal draft a first prompt there: nothing produces
  `first_prompt` for Antigravity, and prompt adoption is Claude Code and Codex only. On a harness
  with no observed-record reader, the press withholds with `no-record-reader` rather than saying
  the record is empty. The page's
  record column still prints "No entry in the observed record names this session." for those
  harnesses, because it reads `omitted` and not `sources.work.unavailable`; that is a web
  follow-up.
- With no reader on this machine, the route's reason replaces the button. The four no-producer
  tokens and an unpublished route draw no inert button, which narrows NUI-18 for this one case
  ([An inert control is present and refusing](design-next-ui.md#an-inert-control-is-present-and-refusing-never-absent)).
- Idle, the button comes first and the DEC-21 disclosure follows it with the hint, and the button is
  described by it. Confirming, the disclosure stays before "Allow and analyze", so the press that
  gives consent still follows the text naming the receiver.
- No meter, no header pill and no "Not checked yet" before a level exists (DRC-4695, DRC-4696). The
  design's idle title becomes false the moment a reading is stored, and a grey scale drawn with no
  level behind it reads the same on every session whether or not anything was read. Amended
  2026-10-01 (owner, Q2, DRC-4758): with a saved intent and no level from any source, and no
  reading stored, "Not checked yet" stands over the unlit four-segment meter and its labels
  ([the result in the button's place](#amended-2026-10-01-the-result-takes-the-buttons-place)).
  The pill stays level-only.
- The header shows the state in Cargento's own words (working, needs input, idle), not the design's
  "Running", which would rename a state across the product from one page.
- The panel is not a scroll container and is not sticky; the page scrolls as one document, so the
  reader-state inventory gains no row. The panel comes first in the markup and the stylesheet places
  it in the second track, so it leads the single column below 1100px with no reordering trick.
- CURRENT ACTIVITY leads the activity column rather than sitting in the panel. The ask block stays
  full width above both columns, because the reader's answer outranks the check.
- The reading offer said "the observed record below", which was true of the markup and false to the
  eye once the record moved to the other column. It now names the column.
- One primary per stage: `Analyze drift` when idle and under a stored reading (DRC-4695 and DRC-4681
  change that later), "Allow and analyze" while confirming, none while analyzing and none with no
  reader. Amended 2026-10-01 (owner, Q3, DRC-4758): under a stored reading the result takes the
  button's place, "Analyze drift" is not drawn, its one "Analyze again" is secondary, and Steer
  back is that stage's primary where a departure stands.
- No Stop session control (DEC-16).
- The fold, measured on a live board at 1440x900: the first build stacked the header one element
  per line (205px) and put Analyze drift's bottom at 1022 on a Claude Code session and 1085 on a
  Codex one, about 115px lower than the one-column page. Following C1's compact header, the header
  is now two rows (state, name and id; then the measured line with the copy controls), the
  revision stamp and "Each save is a revision." share one line, and an outcome line's box shares
  its row with its count and remove. That put the bottom at 820 and 879 with nothing removed. C1
  gives the aside no visible heading, only its "Intent and drift" label, so none was added.
- The fold criterion, reworded by the owner after review: "Analyze drift sits above the fold at
  1440x900 with a goal and up to three outcome lines (the design's textarea footprint); with more
  lines the Drift heading stays above the fold." The owner then scoped it to a session with no
  question waiting (2026-09-24). A waiting question runs full width above both columns, about
  183px with a one-line question, and while it waits answering it is the primary and Analyze drift
  is not; measured with one open, a goal and three lines put Analyze drift's bottom at 964 (Claude
  Code) and 996 (Codex). The owner's fix for the lines themselves: every
  saved line is one row of about one control height. The line grid had three tracks for four items
  (box, count, source, remove), so a saved line's source pushed remove onto a second row and each
  line cost 85px; it now has a track per item. That alone left a goal and three lines at 926 on a
  Codex session and six lines' Drift heading at 1018, so each field's count and controls moved into
  its heading row (before the box, in reading order as on screen) and the panel's gaps tightened.
  Measured at 1440x900 with a 198-character goal: three lines put Analyze drift's bottom at 788
  (Claude Code) and 820 (Codex); six lines put the Drift heading's bottom at 900 on both, with no
  margin, because the six-line notice ("An expected outcome holds six lines...") appears only then.
  Amended 2026-10-01 (owner, Q4, DRC-4758): the criterion is now that the Drift level and the
  Analyze control are visible at 1440x900 with a goal and up to three lines, under the roomier
  boxes of [the intent editor's boxes, buttons and footer](#amended-2026-10-01-the-intent-editors-boxes-buttons-and-footer).
  Amended 2026-10-02 (owner, ask 3): each outcome line is its box, then one row under it with the
  count on the left and Remove on the right, the Goal's own pattern, and a typed line names no
  source. That supersedes the one-row line above and Q4's fold arithmetic, and the owner ruled
  that the ask wins wherever the figure lands. Measured in Chrome with the page laid out at
  1440x900 CSS pixels, on a scratch board serving the assembled page against the panel tests'
  fixture (a 39-character goal, three lines, one added from an entry, Live monitor drawn): Analyze
  drift's bottom moved from 1135 at `5d95ac09` to 1273, about 46px per line. Both are under the
  fold on that fixture, so the 2026-10-01 criterion does not hold for it before or after the
  change; this is reported rather than worked around.
- The saved-intent introduction follows the complete action block (DRC-4748). With a saved
  55-character goal, three 240-character outcome lines and a High live estimate, its three
  lines above the fields put Analyze drift at 892.5 to 936.5 on a 1440x900 board. Moving the
  same words below the action put its bottom at 861.5. The drafted introduction stays with
  the fields the reader is choosing; consent disclosures keep their own order.
- The heading-row move is an owner-approved departure from C1's placement (2026-09-24): each
  field's count and controls sit beside the field's name rather than under its box. Reversed
  2026-10-01 (owner, Q6, DRC-4758): the reader could not tell which box a save belonged to, so
  each field is its label, box and counter again, with one footer under both
  ([the intent editor's boxes, buttons and footer](#amended-2026-10-01-the-intent-editors-boxes-buttons-and-footer)).
- One clean row, expand on focus (owner, 2026-09-24). A saved line longer than its box wrapped and
  showed a half-cut second row, and the goal box a half-cut third. At rest a line box is one
  unwrapped row ending in an ellipsis, and the goal box exactly two whole rows, with no bottom
  padding for a third to show through. On focus each grows to its full text (`field-sizing:
  content`) and returns on blur. It is CSS alone, so the expansion follows focus through a redraw
  and the reader-state inventory gains no row; resizing is off, because a dragged height is an
  inline style the redraw would restore over the focus rule. The value and its count stay the
  whole text. Measured at 1440x900 with a 198-character goal: three lines put Analyze drift's
  bottom at 781 (Claude Code) and 813 (Codex), and six lines put the Drift heading's bottom at 893.
  A focused 102-character line grows to its full text at 1440, 375 and 320 with no horizontal
  overflow. Where an engine lacks `field-sizing` (it ships in Chromium), an `@supports not`
  fallback gives a focused line four rows and the goal six, and the box scrolls inside them.
  Superseded 2026-10-01 (owner, Q4, DRC-4758): the boxes rest roomy and resize vertically, and the
  focus rules are gone ([the intent editor's boxes, buttons and footer](#amended-2026-10-01-the-intent-editors-boxes-buttons-and-footer)).
- At 760px and below, the sheet's existing narrow step, a line's box takes the whole first row and
  its count, source and remove follow on a second in the same order. Sharing one row, the box
  showed about 12 characters at 320; it is now 292px wide there and 327px at 375. At 1440 and 1100
  a line is still one row, so the fold numbers above do not move. Superseded 2026-10-02 (owner, ask
  3): the box has a row of its own at every width, so the narrow step keeps only the source's
  wrap.
- The goal's heading row is top-aligned, with the label and the count each one control tall, so an
  open prompt menu no longer leaves the count, clear and save floating beside its entries
  as though they were its controls. Since 2026-10-01 (owner, Q6) the count and Clear sit under the
  box and the save in the footer, so the heading holds only the label and the prompt marks.

#### Amended 2026-10-01: the intent editor's boxes, buttons and footer

Owner rulings Q4, Q5, Q6 and Q11, 2026-10-01 (DRC-4758 slice D1), on the owner's walk: the goal box
was two rows and each line one, neither resizable; "clear", "save", "add a line" and "remove" read
as bare text; and nothing said which box a save belonged to. This supersedes the heading-row move,
"One clean row, expand on focus" and the goal heading row's alignment above, and rewords the fold
criterion.

- The boxes (Q4). The goal rests at three rows and each outcome line at two; both wrap and resize
  vertically. A dragged height is an inline style that `nextCaptureInputState` carries across a
  redraw (the reader-state inventory's resized-dimensions row), which a test holds, so no rule
  sets a height that follows focus: the at-rest and focus pair put the box back over the drag on
  every blur, which is why resizing had been off. The untouched draft and the pending line still
  size to their text, and an inline height still outranks that. Fold criterion: the Drift level
  and the Analyze control are visible at 1440x900 with a goal and up to three lines.
- The controls (Q5) are the next-action primitive, secondary or quiet and never primary: Save
  intent is secondary; Undo changes, Clear and + Add a line are quiet; a line's remove is a quiet
  "×" named "Remove line N". Clear stays the lightest weight against the discard control's box and
  its armed 2px border, so the irreversible act still reads heavier (DRC-4590 AC-5, kept as a
  weight comparison). The field's own bare-button rule steps aside for the primitive.
- The layout (Q6). Each field is its label, its box and its counter. Clear sits under the goal box
  and + Add a line under the list. One footer under both fields holds the hint "Drift is measured
  against these. Edit anything that is off.", said once whether or not the goal is drafted, then
  Undo changes and Save intent, both inert while nothing has changed (NUI-18). The groups stand
  22px apart.
- Save intent writes both fields in one `POST /api/annotate`: `goal` where the box left the stored
  words and is not back at the draft, `lines` and `origins` where the list changed, and an absent
  or null field is left alone, with the revision both were drawn against. Over an untouched draft
  with nothing else changed a press adopts the draft, never a typed save of an excerpt. Undo changes
  is Escape for both fields at once. Its cue is one, in the footer. Amended 2026-10-02 (owner):
  Save intent is enabled over an untouched draft, since it is now the draft's only save; Looks
  right is gone.
- Absence (Q11). An empty field's absence is its empty box and placeholder. The sentence ("No goal
  typed for this session.", "No expected outcome typed.") stays in the DOM, visually hidden, as
  the inert save's description. The store-unreadable sentence stays in view, because it says the
  words may exist where the box shows none.
- The stamp over saved words reads "Saved", not the design's "Confirmed": a saved revision is the
  reader's own words, and nothing confirmed them.
- Not built here, noted as follow-ups: one multi-line Expected outcome box (the rows stay, drawn as
  one checklist); Enter, Backspace and multi-line paste splitting lines (IE-7); the "Use your
  prompt" menu, which is slice D2.
- The header chip says "needs input" whenever a question is waiting, whatever state the collector
  inferred. After `session_ended` pops the overlay, the state falls back to the collector's
  `working` or `idle` while the ask stays open, and the chip read "working" beside "ended".

#### Amended 2026-10-01: the session page's text is tiered to a word budget

Owner, 2026-10-01 (DRC-4758 slice E; Q9 of the decision block, and the complaint "so much text it
is unclear where to look"). The panel is held to a measured budget, counted by the shared
visibility helper with the boxes' own words left out: an idle-drafted aside on Claude Code with
consent given shows no more than about 90 words (79 at this build), and an aside under a stored
reading no more than about 160 (96 at this build). Every sentence moved to meet it stays in the
DOM behind a worded summary, under tier 2 of
[NUI-19](design-next-ui.md#nui-19-a-caveat-has-three-tiers); absences and anything the reader acts
on stay in view.

- What a reading is (the offer that opened the READING section) sits inside "What is sent", after
  the provider disclosure, while no reading is stored; where no disclosure is published it sits
  behind "What a reading reads". The READING section is drawn only for a stored reading this build
  could not read, and that sentence stays in view. A malformed reading keeps the section.
- The saved introduction ("Choose a goal or use your prompt, then analyze drift...") sits behind
  "What analysis does". Amended 2026-10-02 (NU-10): under a stored reading it is not drawn, because
  the step it explains is done.
- The later-direction block is one summary naming its state: "Later directions: none since your
  save", "Later directions: settled 5m ago", or "Later directions: unknown (record unread)". The
  unread state is in the summary, so it is never a silent all-clear
  ([DEC-20](#dec-20-the-first-screen-shows-goal-beside-direction-and-drift-has-one-home)); the
  state sentences and the steer paragraph sit behind it.
- "Discard everything" is a summary holding the server's why, the `Discard everything` control
  (its summary's own words since NU-20, 2026-10-02; armed, it reads `Confirm discard`)
  and, once armed, its warning. Armed, it is drawn open and outside the restore lane, so a redraw
  cannot shut the warning that describes the armed control (DRC-4564). The account of a landed or
  failed discard stays in view.
- Departures (Q9). The section is drawn only where the unasked lane holds rows, collapsed under
  "Raised while you were away: N", and holds the definition, the rows with their ways back, how
  each was raised, the counts and the steer paragraph. With the lane on and nothing raised, the
  lane's own sentence (not checked, checked and found nothing, or a cap spent) stays in view with
  the rest behind "About these checks", because those are three facts and silence reads as the
  reassuring one. The reading's departures are said once, in the result: the section's "From the
  reading you asked for" part, its "No reading has been made at your request" sentence and its
  per-departure way back are not drawn, and the reading's cutoff moved into "What it read". The
  result-placement bullet's "a malformed reading, a refused one and no reading keep it" now reads
  "a malformed reading and a refused one keep it".
- The activity column beside the panel is tiered the same way (328 visible words to 125 on the
  idle-drafted fixture). Under the record, where the harness's work results are read, one clause
  stays in view ("Results are as the tool reported; not inspected.") and the mix, the bounds, the
  check scan and the full limit sit behind "About this record"; where none are read, the limit is
  the absence and stays in view. The route's tool-output sentence is said once on the page, in
  "What is sent"; the record's line no longer repeats it. The facts keep NEXT STEP and BLOCKED in
  view and put TURN, OUTCOME, GIT STATE and PROJECT behind "Session facts: <outcome> · <git
  state>", because HOW IT LANDED says both again; a block note that only restates its value
  ("Reporter available", "No block-state reading available") is not drawn, here or on the
  Sessions list. Command-shape reports, on the session page, are one summary while off or
  unsupported, and the list or "No command-shape reports." with the caveats behind "About these
  reports" while on; Attention keeps its whole section. A missing way back is one clause beside
  the header's controls ("No resume command", "No terminal to raise", "Terminal raise off"),
  said once per page before any departure (DRC-4658), with the cause behind "Why". HOW IT LANDED
  keeps "Neither card implies the other." in view with its reason behind "Why two cards", and the
  Intent-log pointer is the link with what it keeps behind "What it keeps".
- Not built here, noted as follow-ups: a per-row source behind a row-level disclosure; the ended
  note's shorter form; "Run setup" beside an off command-shape section; the same tiering on
  Attention's command-shape section.

### What the numbering build decided, 2026-09-25

DRC-4694 built item 11 and item 6's flags in the session's activity. The owner ruled the first four
calls below on the issue; the rest follow the analysis.

- What is numbered. With no saved intent, or with the annotation store off, the whole record is
  numbered from its first timed entry. With one, #1 is the first entry at the evidence-window start
  (item 13). Earlier entries are counted ("2 earlier entries") and not listed. An entry with no
  published time cannot be placed in a window, so it is counted the same way and never numbered.
- A cited entry from before the window, or with no time, is listed anyway, unnumbered: a
  pre-window one with its time, an untimed one with neither. Whether a reading should cite a
  pre-window entry at all was filed separately, and ruled on 2026-09-27: it may not
  ([what the window build decided](#what-the-window-build-decided-2026-09-27)). This path now serves
  a reading stored with no window start, and a check whose result landed inside the window though
  its call began before it, since numbering stays on the call time.
- A window that opens at a reader's message should have an entry at that moment. Where none sits
  there because the record read no longer reaches back that far, the list says so rather than
  calling a later entry #1. A window at the save time is typed words with no earlier message, and
  nothing is expected there.
- Numbers are stable only while entries arrive at the end. Four things renumber every entry after
  the one that moved: a check re-runs, because the check tracker publishes one entry per check keyed
  by its latest run; a file is written again, because the latest write is kept; the listing of at
  most twelve checks and files reshuffles, because failures are kept first and a new one can evict a
  pass from the middle; and the observer snapshot moves with each snapshot. A fifth since
  [2026-10-03](#amended-2026-10-03-owner-the-agents-own-words-are-evidence): an agent message
  leaves the transcript tail the board reads, and since it is never stored in the session history
  it drops out of the list and the entries after it renumber. A departure that cited it then reads
  as citing nothing resolvable, with the generic sentence: a citation is a hashed fact id, so the
  page cannot tell that the entry it named was one of the agent's messages. The list and every
  citation are recomputed together on each render, so the screen never disagrees with itself, and
  item 7's correction carries times as well as numbers. A server-published ordinal per fact would
  fix this and is a Python layer of its own.
- Order is time, with the fact id breaking a tie, so two checks with one call time number the same
  whatever order the payload sent.
- "Cited" comes only from the current stored reading's departures that survived every page rule, and
  each criterion row now carries the ids it still rests on. A demoted departure, a consistent row, a
  refused or malformed reading and a replaced one flag nothing. A consistent row's entries are listed
  and not flagged.
- "A later direction you gave" is a person's entry after the words' own time, read by the same
  predicate the conflict block narrows to the unsettled ones, so the two cannot disagree. It stays
  flagged once settled, because settling says the baseline still applies, not that the direction was
  never given. It is never called drift (DEC-16).
- The bound is the newest twenty entries in the window that are not checks or files, and every
  check and file in the window. A check or file from before the window is counted with the earlier
  entries and not drawn, where every listed one used to be. When nothing is numbered but the record
  holds earlier or untimed entries, the list says no entry is from after the window opened (or that
  none has a time) rather than that the record names nothing. Every entry a departure cites is drawn as well, at its own number, so the gaps in
  the numbering show and no expand control is needed. A later direction past the bound is counted,
  not drawn; the conflict block lists the unsettled ones.
- The list sits right after CURRENT ACTIVITY under the column's "Session activity" heading, and the
  OBSERVED RECORD heading is retired. The header's second row says "N entries" and omits the count,
  rather than showing 0, when the record was not read.
- The design's strings this replaces: "Key turns" is gone; "Drift began", "Off goal" and "Breaks
  outcome" become "Cited" or "A later direction you gave"; "In progress" is the source's own words;
  an entry is one fact, so "2 files" and other per-turn counts are not drawn. Your message reads
  "You · Prompt", the agent's entries "Agent", and Cargento's own summary of the session "Cargento's
  summary", never the agent.

### What the direction-adoption server build decided, 2026-09-27

DRC-4682's server half built item 4's two answers and the store they write. The owner ruled that
Add over an unsaved draft adopts it in the same write, and that Keep settles even where no analysis
can start. The page half comes after it.

- The wire. Opening a direction is its own route, `POST /api/direction`, because it answers with
  text rather than the annotate reply. Saving it is the `add_direction` field of
  `POST /api/annotate`, beside the settle arm, because it writes the same annotation and answers
  the same way. SECURITY.md states what the open returns and to whom.
- What counts as later. A person's message in the session's own record after the words' own time:
  an adopted goal's source time, the time a typed goal's words were saved, and with no saved goal
  the draft's time, the first prompt or else the latest. A revision holding lines and no goal still
  counts as no goal. The typed goal's save time is its own stored field, `goal_saved_at`, published
  as `annotation_goal_saved_at`: a lines-only save and an added direction mint a revision without
  moving it, and only new goal words do. Review found that flooring typed words at the latest
  revision instead meant adding one direction hid a later one the reader never answered, where
  adopted words kept it open; the two now behave alike. A revision an older build saved has no
  such field and falls back to its save time.
- The text. It is read again from the transcript tail by recomputing each message's fact id,
  because a Claude user message carries no record id. The id was not changed to add one: that
  would move every stored citation of a Claude message. A message older than the tail is refused
  with one sentence, never replaced by its clipped summary. The open returns the whole message
  scrubbed as a save would scrub it, up to 2,000 characters, with a clipped flag and the store's
  own answer to whether it fits as a line. The record reader cuts a message at the same 2,000
  characters first, so raw text that reaches the bound counts as clipped; one of exactly 2,000 is
  flagged too, which says less was shown than was, the safe error.
- One refusal body. An unknown session or fact, another session's entry, one that is not a
  person's message, one not later than the words and one older than the tail all answer the same
  200 body, so the route says nothing about which sessions exist.
- The write. The line, the settlement through that direction's time and, over a draft, the adopted
  goal go in one store write, under the revision the page drafted against. A full list is refused
  unless the body names the line to replace, counted from 0 as `origins` is. A settlement never
  moves back over one the reader already gave, so adding an older direction reopens nothing.
- Keep. The reading press carries `settle_through`, and the settlement, with the adoption over a
  draft, is written before the route, the permission and the job, so a press that starts nothing
  has still settled. Every later reply of that press carries the store's token as `settled`, a 503
  for want of a thread included, and a refused settlement answers 422 and starts nothing. Where no
  analysis can start at all, the page sends the same answer to `POST /api/annotate`. Both name
  `expected_revision`, checked under the store lock, so a stale tab settles nothing, and neither
  adopts over a saved goal that holds other words. A settlement never moves back over one already
  given, on Keep as on Add.
- One process. The revision check holds inside one dashboard process; two dashboards sharing the
  store can still race, and these writes share that gap with every other save (DRC-4661).
- Not permanent. A line added from an entry becomes a typed line once the reader edits it and
  saves, as an edited adopted goal becomes typed, so "added from #n" lasts until the first edit.

### What the draft and question page build decided, 2026-09-27

DRC-4682's page half, on the server half's wire, built to the owner's decisions of the same date:
no level or pill over an unsaved draft, every unsettled later direction drawn at its own number, the
question before the press in place of "Conflict to settle", and Add adopting a draft in its write.

- The draft. The goal box holds the first prompt as Cargento publishes it, or the latest where no
  first prompt with a time is published, marked "from your prompt" (and "latest" for the second),
  with "Shown excerpt only." on a clipped one, a tinted box and (until the owner's 2026-10-02
  amendment, which leaves Save intent the one save) Looks right. It is derived on every
  render and never written, so it is not reader state; an edit rides the held draft as any other,
  and a box put back to the draft's words is the draft again, so saving it adopts rather than
  storing an excerpt as typed words. Nothing is drafted over a store this build cannot read. The
  design's line "Drift is measured against these. Edit anything that is off." takes the lede's
  place over a draft rather than adding a row: the six-line fold had 7px to spare at 1440x900, and
  still has (893 before and after).
- The edited box. Analyze, Keep and Add's save are refused whenever the goal box differs from what
  it stands on (the saved goal, or the draft) or the outcome-lines draft differs from what the
  server holds, because each would stand on words not on screen and then drop the edit. Analyze and
  Keep say "Save your intent, or undo your edit, to analyze drift."; Add says "Save your intent, or
  undo your edit, to add this direction." beside its pending line, not in the Drift control. A held
  goal is forgotten after a press only while it still equals the draft that press adopted, so
  nothing typed while a request is open is dropped (fix round). An outcome line typed while Add's
  save is open is kept too, and the stored line joins it with its place in the new list as its
  origin, so the next lines save keeps the added direction rather than deleting it (second fix
  round).
- No level. `nextIntentDrafted` is the one predicate the level and the live estimate consult;
  `nextDriftEstimate` is the empty seam they fill, and a test stubs it to prove the guard can fail.
  "Save your intent to see a live estimate" is DRC-4696's.
- The floor. The page reads `annotation_goal_saved_at` for a typed goal, as the server does, so the
  list's flag, the question and the route agree about what is later.
- The question. It stands in the control's place, with Keep the one primary and Add beside it.
  Keep is never the consent, so the disclosure stands after it, and only where Keep will analyze. "since your first prompt" replaces "since
  saving your intent" over a draft. Of several directions it quotes the earliest, the one Add
  opens (owner, 2026-09-28): quoting the latest named a direction Add could not reach until the
  ones before it were added or kept. The number is `nextCockpitEntryNumbers`'; the sentence drops it
  rather than naming one the list did not give. The block after the reading keeps only its neutral
  states (nothing since, settled, unread).
- Keep's route. Where the page already knows no analysis can start (no reader, model calls off, no
  provider enabled, a job running, the daily cap), Keep goes to `POST /api/annotate` and reads
  `Keep my intent`. Where an Allow is still owed it goes there too, with no `allow` and no
  `tool_output`, and then says "Kept your intent and settled the direction. Press Allow and analyze
  to send it for a reading." over the confirming step's "Allow and analyze" (owner, fix round).
  Otherwise it goes to `POST /api/reading`. Either way it names `expected_revision`, a refused
  settlement says nothing was settled, the outcome is written to the polite live region, and a
  settle hands focus to the next primary. The region is the only place it is announced: the
  sentence beside the control is drawn without `role="status"`, so a screen reader hears it once.
  Each press empties the region first if it still holds the last Keep sentence, so the same
  outcome twice is announced twice, and the unsaved-edit refusal is written there too. The next
  Analyze or Allow press takes Keep's sentence back out.
- Parity and polish (DRC-4732, DRC-4734, DRC-4726, DRC-4736; owner, 2026-09-28). Keep opens every
  direction it would settle through `POST /api/direction` before it settles anything. Only a sole
  direction whose whole text is the summary the question quotes settles in one press, because of
  several the question quotes the earliest alone. Otherwise the question draws them all whole,
  says nothing was settled, and the next press settles what was drawn under the revision captured
  at the draw; a direction arriving between the presses is drawn by the next one instead of
  settled. Where one cannot be opened, Keep is refused (fix round, wire review F1 and F2). Analyze and the plain goal save
  send the revision the page drew. `/api/reading` refuses a stale one with 409 `revision-changed`
  before the route, any Allow write, the adoption or the job, reading the store from disk under
  its lock and checking the entry handed to the job again, so another dashboard's save is caught, and the page says the approved stale
  sentence; the store already refused a stale goal save, and the typed words stay in the box.
  A typed save whose words and provenance equal the stored revision's answers "Already stored"
  whatever revision it names, because nothing is written (owner, 2026-10-02: a double press or a
  retry after a lost answer was told "Not saved" about words on disk).
  `nextReadingCheckSupports` mirrors `check_supports` on every harness, including `changed_after`,
  `read_incomplete` and the subjectless Pi rows an older build stored, held by a test built from the server's own Pi
  fixture; the record column opens with "Cargento reads work results from Claude Code and Pi
  only." The analyzing box lost `role="status"`, which re-announced it on every render: its start
  and its outcome are written once each to the persistent polite region. The question adds no
  full stop after a quote that ends in its own mark, and the Intent heading's keyboard focus draws
  the accent ring.
- Landing and holding still. The Sessions goal link lands on the Intent heading over an untouched
  draft, and in the box only where nothing is drafted. The drafted box and the pending line are
  as tall as their text whether focused or not. The first fix round held the focused draft at its
  two-row resting height so Keep would not move under the press, and that hid the rest of the
  draft Keep adopts (137 characters showed about 80 at 375px). A box that grew on focus and shrank
  on the mousedown that blurred it swallowed the first press on the button below it, which is
  what the pending line did to its save, a second Add and Keep (second fix round).
- Add. It opens the earliest unsettled direction, so its save settles through that one only and the
  question comes back for any later one (fix round; the build first opened the newest, which
  settled the earlier ones unanswered). The pending line is one per session beside the lines draft,
  with no `maxlength`, so a long direction is shown whole and counted over the bound, and its save
  stays inert with a sentence rather than cutting it. At six saved lines the reader names the line
  to replace. The line label reads "from #n · not saved", with the number recomputed from the fact
  id on every render, and the line goes once its direction is no longer open. A second Add press
  while it is pending focuses it rather than reopening it over the reader's edits. "added from #n"
  on a saved line is DRC-4697's.
- Every open direction is drawn. One from before the intent's window is drawn with its time and no
  number, as a cited earlier entry is, and is not counted among the earlier entries left unlisted,
  so the question never names a direction the list does not show.

### What the window build decided, 2026-09-27

DRC-4715 asked whether a reading may cite an entry from before its evidence window. The owner ruled
no, and that such a citation is refused the way any other unsupported citation is. The build
decisions below follow that ruling and the DRC-4702 decisions of the same date.

- The rule covers every entry type, not only checks. An entry with no time cannot be placed after
  the words, so it is refused too once a window is open. A reading with no window start refuses
  nothing on these grounds.
- "Before the window" is read by when an entry's evidence arrived: a check's result time where one
  was recorded, its call time otherwise. A check whose call began before the words and whose result
  landed after them is inside the window.
- `reading.produce` drops these entries from the list it numbers, beside the last-turn cap, so the
  model is never offered one. That follows `_citable`'s rule that a row the resolver must refuse is
  never numbered. It is done there rather than in `build_ledger`, which is the page-parity contract
  and which the abstention scorer also reads.
- The resolver's rule 3 refuses such an entry as well, and the page's copy refuses one in a reading
  stored before this, so a line resting only on it reads "uncited" on both sides and falls to "not
  verifiable". No new reason token was needed.
- Two more reasons come before those, because a record that was never read is not an empty one
  (DRC-4689). `no-record-reader` is for a harness Cargento has no observed-record reader for:
  Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Goose, Droid and Gemini CLI. Their collectors still read prompts and
  titles for the board, so the sentence says that and no more (owner, 2026-09-27): "Cargento
  reads only this harness's prompts and titles, not the session's work, so there is nothing to
  read your words against. No reading was made and nothing was spent." `record-unread` is for a
  harness that has a reader and whose transcript was not found. Both withhold before the ledger
  and spend nothing.
  Antigravity has a reader for the person's typed directions alone, so its reading runs on those.
- Three reasons for reading nothing, each said only where it is true (owner, 2026-09-27).
  `ledger-empty` is for a record with no entry naming the session. `window-empty` is for a record
  whose every entry is from before the words or has no time. It is decided over the whole record,
  before the last-turn stop cut. `after-stop` is for a record that does hold entries after the
  words, every one of them after the session's last observed stop, as a resumed turn the row has
  not caught up with leaves it: "Everything after your words came after the session's last
  observed stop, so there is nothing finished to read yet."
- The cutoff sentence counts each set honestly (owner, 2026-09-27): "Read 2 of the 3 entries
  after your words; 1 earlier and 1 untimed entries were not read; 1 entry after the last observed
  stop was not read." Each clause appears only when its count is not zero, in the singular for
  one, and the time and author mix follow in their own sentence, "Of those read, ...".

### What the Steer back and Update intent build decided, 2026-09-28

DRC-4681 built item 7 and DRC-4697 built item 8, to the owner's rulings of 2026-09-28: the template
approved as exact text, the server composing with placeholders and times while the page fills in
"#n", no Steer back with nothing to steer from, consistent lines dropped before a refusal over 2,000
characters, the Copy cue reusing "Copied" and "Copy unavailable", the direction offered, and the
saved-line labels. The calls the rulings left open:

- The route is `POST /api/correction`, answering parts rather than a published field, because
  composition reads the record, and a per-session field would compose on every collection for a
  box few readers open. A part is text or `{"entry": fact_id}`. The page writes the first number
  it draws as "(#n in Cargento)" and the rest as "(#n)", as the template shows them, and an entry
  it does not number keeps only its time, which the server already wrote.
- Each line's state is the stored reading's, re-derived against the record as it is now with the
  page's rules for whether a verdict survives: a reading of an older revision lends no state, an
  unsettled later direction demotes a departure, a citation must resolve inside the reading's
  window, and on Claude Code an outcome-line verdict stands only where the route can carry checks
  (`nextReadingOutputLimit`). A stored `why` the page knows never demotes a row, because the page
  applies one only after its own rules have left the row unverifiable; one it does not know demotes
  it as unreadable. Otherwise the text could claim a departure the panel beside it has demoted. A
  goal departure counts as something to steer from, and the template says it as "Back to my goal".
- One sentence each for a failed check and a later direction, at the latest of each. A settled
  later direction still counts, because settling records that the baseline still applies, not
  that the reader never said it. A copied correction is never one.
- Consistent lines are dropped one at a time, the last first, until the text fits. Every
  placeholder is counted at six digits, so the page's text never passes 2,000 whatever it numbers.
  Both sides count characters as code points: the page has no `maxlength`, which counts UTF-16
  units, so a correction of emoji is shown whole and one keystroke never cuts it. An edit past
  the cap is cut from the run it inserted, by whole characters, and never from the text already
  there: keeping the first 2,000 code points of the whole value cut a mid-text paste's tail and
  split "é" into a bare "e".
  DRC-4739 intercepts ordinary cap-crossing insertions before they land, using the browser's native
  edit transaction. On Chrome, assigning the trimmed value after a paste erased Undo; inserting
  the fitted text through the native edit command kept Undo and Redo. Paste uses its clipboard
  event because textarea `beforeinput` carried neither `data` nor `dataTransfer`. An unavailable
  native insertion refuses the edit and keeps the existing text. Return's null-data
  `insertLineBreak` and `insertParagraph` events mean a newline; one that fits, including by
  replacing a selection, proceeds as an ordinary edit. At the cap it keeps all existing text.
  Composition is different: its
  provisional text stands until the commit, and an overflowing commit is refused whole. Native
  Undo is used only when it restores the exact pre-composition text; otherwise that text is
  restored by assignment, with a sentence saying Undo is unavailable for the refused edit. This
  is preservation of the reader's words, not a claim that every browser supports the native edit.
  Automatic paints wait while the edited correction has focus, with a visible sentence saying
  updates are paused until the reader leaves the box. New payloads still arrive in memory. Blur
  draws the latest record after any pointer click dispatch and keeps the committed text;
  native Undo is preserved during editing,
  and ends when that redraw replaces the editor. Retaining and moving the same textarea did not
  keep Chrome's Undo history, even through a continuously connected atomic move.
- Claude Code only, as the copy route is, so a paste of the correction can be recognised coming
  back. An unknown session and another harness answer what a session with nothing to steer from
  does.
- Placement. Steer back takes the control's slot on the first screen rather than the result's rows,
  which ran to 2,567px at 1440x900 with six lines when it was first drawn there. Under a surviving
  departure it is the one primary with Update intent instead beside it, and Analyze drift follows
  as a secondary, the design's "Analyze again". With no reader it is the primary beside the route's
  reason. With a reader and no departure it is a secondary after Analyze drift. It is not drawn
  while the question before the press stands, since the question owns that slot and Keep is its
  primary. The result stage gains nothing, so DRC-4695 renders around it.
- The box is labelled "Correction to copy" with the hint "Cargento never sends this. Copy it and
  paste it into the session." Copy writes the box's text, frozen at the press, and posts it to
  `POST /api/correction/copied` only after the clipboard took it. The owner approved "Copy",
  "Nothing recorded now gives a correction to steer back from." and "Could not compose a
  correction. Press Steer back again to retry." on 2026-09-28. A press over either refusal asks
  again, in one press.
  Copy during a recomposition reads "Copy unavailable" and copies nothing; an active native
  composition is not copied either.
- An open box follows the record. The press stamps what composition read: the saved words'
  revision, the settlement, the stored reading's `read_at`, and the entries the parts cite. A
  change in any of them drops a text the reader has not edited, which is recomposed from the server
  where there is still something to steer from and closed where there is not, so Copy never records
  a text composed from a record that no longer holds. An edited text stays the reader's, marked
  "This was composed from an older record. Recompose replaces your edit with a correction from the
  record as it stands." beside a Recompose button; both wait on the owner.
  While a quiet recomposition is out, the old box keeps its exact last rendered text, including its
  old entry numbers. An edit or input-method composition begun before the answer keeps the reader's
  text and sets that answer aside. The [reader-state inventory](design-reader-state.md) owns the
  focused-edit and composition paint pauses.
- Update intent instead offers the direction a surviving departure cites, else the latest later
  direction, through Add's own `POST /api/direction`, skipping any direction already saved as a
  line; with none left it adds the empty line. The store refuses an entry already saved as another
  line through the same refusal a stale revision gets, so no route can add it twice. The pending line it opens stands while its
  direction is any later direction, settled or not, where Add's own line stands only while its
  direction is unsettled. With no later direction it adds an empty outcome line, focused, and at
  six lines it says the existing six-line sentence and adds nothing. Where a pending line's reason is
  that sentence (six saved lines, no line chosen to replace), it says it beside its own save and
  the list's copy is hidden, so it is drawn once rather than above and below the replace choices
  (DRC-4760). A line giving another reason (over the character bound, or an unsaved edit while the
  draft holds six lines) leaves the list's copy drawn, so the disabled add control keeps a reason
  on screen. Once a line to replace is chosen the line gives no reason and the list's copy stands. The server already added a
  settled direction: `annotations.direction_floor` never read the settlement.
- A saved line added from an entry reads "added from #12" where the list numbers that entry and
  "added from your direction at 14:04" where it does not. With no record read, or the entry gone
  from it, it keeps "added from an entry". The reading's row label beside a line still says "ADDED
  FROM AN ENTRY", which DRC-4695's result renders anew.

### What the result build decided, 2026-09-28

DRC-4695 built items 6, 10 and 14 on the session page, with the analysis-derived level of
[DEC-26](#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn). The rulings left these open,
and each was settled on the withholding side.

- The level is the server's. `http_api` calls `levels.analysis_level` over the stored reading and
  the record as the focused project context holds it, and publishes it as
  `sources.work.analysis_levels` on that answer alone, recomputed on every fetch and never written.
  The lines a reading must answer are those of the revision it read, not today's; a revision the
  store no longer holds gives no level. The page draws it only for the reading it shows, matched by
  `read_at` and revision, in the level slot, labelled "Analysis" with its time and item 1's source
  line. It is drawn over the live estimate, as the design's result stage draws it, and its pill
  shows whichever way the live monitor is set, since the switch hides the live level only. A
  reading of a revision other than the saved one draws no level, in the slot or the pill, so the
  live estimate stands when the switch is on and nothing does when it is off. The server scores that
  reading against the lines it read, and a level for words the reader has since replaced says
  nothing about today's, which is the live estimate's own rule below. The reading keeps its
  "Your intent changed" banner and "Analyze again".
- The page holds "None or low" to its own rows. Where the level says None or low and a line the
  panel draws is not a consistent it can word, the level reads "Not enough recorded yet". The
  validated function counts a departure the page has demoted (an unsettled later direction, say),
  so the level can read Medium beside an answer of "Can't tell". That is the cautious direction and
  was left as validated rather than re-ruled here.
- Each line reads "Departs at #n", "Consistent with #n, as the tool reported; not inspected" for a
  Claude Code tool report or any harness's check, "Consistent with what the session said at #n; not
  a check" otherwise, or "Can't tell". In the Drift card the qualifier is said in the line's Evidence rather than
  in view (item 6's 2026-10-01 amendment). The number is the activity list's. An entry the list does not
  number is named by its time, as a line added from an unnumbered entry is. "Can't tell" carries
  the page's own reason beneath it where the page has one, and reads "Can't tell: nothing recorded
  shows this yet" where it has none. A line added from an entry is labelled by the list's number,
  "ADDED FROM #n", as the saved line above it reads.
- The answer reducer runs over the rows after every page rule. Under a surviving departure it is
  the headline "Departs from your intent" with the count beside it and, as the short account, each
  departure's detail followed by its citation. With none, a failed check in the reading's window,
  where a check with no time counts as inside it as `analysis_level` reads it, gives "A check failed
  at #n." naming the latest; then any line without a valid verdict gives "Can't tell"; then
  "Nothing found against what it read. This is not a check that the work was done." That last
  rung needs at least one outcome line among the rows: otherwise a reading of a goal with no line,
  which the producer does not withhold, answers "Can't tell", as the level beside it reads "Not enough
  recorded yet" (DEC-26 item 1). A reading of
  the words shown now draws every line typed now, so a line it returned nothing for is a missing
  result and cannot tell; a reading of older words draws only the lines it read.
- Where the work went groups written paths in the saved analysis window by folder, with a path
  without a folder under "The working directory". Its count comes from the scan's distinct paths
  at or after that reading's cutoff, before the twelve-entry check and file listing is capped. A
  path last written before that cutoff is absent from both the rows and the count. The section can
  still show a count when all its paths fell out of the listing. A path retained from the saved
  window but absent from today's numbered view is labelled as unnumbered; it is not assigned a
  number from another entry. If the matching count is unavailable, the section says so.
- Stale says why. Changed words give "Your intent changed after this analysis." with the revision
  sentence the raises use; otherwise an entry newer than the reading's `evidence_through` gives "New
  work since this analysis.". A reading stored without that time, which only rows from before
  2026-09-24 are, counts from its `read_at` instead, so work after it still says so. "Analyze again"
  is drawn in the banner only where a press would run: a reader, no refusal, no job, and no question
  before the press standing, which Keep answers.
- Not accurate is a toggle on the reading shown, posted through `POST /api/annotate` with the
  reading's `read_at`, and the store refuses a mark naming any other reading. Only the token is
  stored. A press the store does not take says so under the button until the next press.

#### Amended 2026-10-01: the result takes the button's place

Owner rulings Q2, Q3 and Q10, 2026-10-01 (DRC-4758 slice C). The owner's walk never saw a level: the
result sat in a READING section below the fold, under a second "Analyze drift", and read as nothing
having happened. This supersedes the placement in the bullets above; their wording rules are kept.

- The Drift card's rows are the design's: "Drift" with its subtitle and the Live monitor switch;
  the one hint line where the switch can be turned on and no reading is stored; the level block;
  then the slot that holds the control or the result. Nothing is built from the rejected designs A
  and B.
- The level block is the level word with its source beside it, the four-segment meter, and the
  meter's labels "None or low", "Medium", "High", "Extreme" under its segments with the current one
  marked. The labels are hidden from a screen reader, which already has the level word.
- "Not checked yet" (Q2) is drawn over the unlit meter and its labels with a saved intent, no level
  from any source and no reading stored. It names a process state, never "no drift", is never drawn
  over an unsaved draft or once a reading is stored, and draws no pill.
- The time is said once. The source chip reads "Analysis" alone, the item 1 line keeps "From the
  analysis at <time>", and a caption under it carries the range alone: "#a to #b", the first and
  last entries the activity list numbers inside the window the reading read, or "#a" when they are
  one entry.
- Why the level is what it is: one page-owned sentence per closed `levels.REASONS` token
  (`NEXT_DRIFT_REASON_LINES` for what a level rests on, `NEXT_DRIFT_BLOCKER_LINES` for what holds one
  back, `NEXT_DRIFT_REASON_SILENT` for the three that need no sentence; a test walks the set and
  gives each token exactly one home). Under Medium and above the first reason reads under the
  meter, numbered from the level's cites where the cite is the kind the token names; under "Not
  enough recorded yet" the blockers sit behind "Why not None or low". A later direction is said as
  yours and unsettled, never as drift. An unknown token renders nothing. The live estimate's level
  uses the same maps.
- The live estimate's callout, "This is a quick estimate. Analyze to see what drifted and how to
  steer back.", sits directly under its level at High or Extreme, before the control; the
  analyzing box keeps "You can keep working. The result will appear here." under its steps.
- Under a stored, readable reading and no job, the slot holds the result in this order: the stale
  callout if any; the headline and its account under a departure only; the goal row; "Against
  expected outcome", an ordered list with one item per outcome line; Where the work went; Steer back
  and Update intent instead; "Analyze again"; Not accurate; then "What it read", one click away with
  the definition, the model stamp, the baseline's source, the cutoff and the revision. The READING
  section is not drawn there. A malformed reading, a refused one and no reading keep it.
- Each checklist line is a glyph, the line's own words as its title, the ruled status beneath, and
  "Evidence" one click away holding the source tag, the why and the limit. The glyph is shape first:
  a cross for departs in the panel's clay (Q10), a neutral filled dot for consistent, never a check
  and never green, and a dashed circle for can't tell. "#n" stays text, not a link, because the page
  routes on its fragment.
- One "Analyze again" (Q3). It is the same control as "Analyze drift", so it keeps every refusal,
  the consent step and the count, and is inert with its reason wherever the press would be refused.
  It is never the stage's primary. A stale result holds it in the callout, and Steer back keeps its
  own row at the foot; a current result holds it at the foot beside Steer back. While the question
  before the press stands, no press is drawn under the result. While a job runs the analyzing box
  takes the slot alone and the old result is not drawn.
- The end of a job that stored a reading is announced as "The analysis finished. Its result is in
  the Drift section.", with no positional word, so it is true at every width.

### What the slash-command build decided, 2026-10-01

DRC-4764. A Claude Code reader who directed work with `/pr-review-response 1287 …` or `/review`
had given a later direction that the observed record dropped, so a reading could call the work
they asked for a departure. The command is the reader's message in the harness's markup, and every
line of that markup opens with `<`, which the record reader skips.

- A prompt command is a direction, with arguments or without. It is published as
  `transcripts.prompt_title` renders it, `/name` and its arguments on one line, redacted and then
  bounded as any message is. It is a person entry in a reading's ledger and a later direction on
  the page, and "Add it to my intent" offers the command as typed, not its tags.
- A local command is not, with arguments or without: `/compact keep the notes` drives the harness.
  The record says which a command is by the tag it opens with. Measured over the local store's
  main-thread records: all 1,477 that open with `<command-message>` are followed by the command's
  expanded prompt, and all 945 that open with `<command-name>` are followed by the harness's own
  output, 903 of them after its local-command caveat. No command name falls in both. The local
  names seen were `/clear`, `/login`, `/plugin`, `/mcp`, `/compact`, `/add-dir`,
  `/reload-plugins`, `/model`, `/exit`, `/design-login`, `/chrome`, `/reload-skills`, `/effort`,
  `/rate-limit-options`, `/context`, `/install-github-app`, `/stickers`, `/usage-credits` and
  `/permissions`. The rule reads the tag rather than this list, so a new local command is refused
  without being named.
- A prompt command on `records.harness_control`'s list, `/insights` the one seen, is refused too.
- The goal slot and the instruction line beneath a title read controls by the same predicate,
  `transcripts.harness_control_prompt`, so the three cannot disagree. Before, they matched that
  list against the rendered line, which only a bare command can match, and published
  `/compact keep notes` as a goal and as the work asked for. Over the local store this refuses
  152 more prompts and refuses none it used to: `/compact` 90, `/add-dir` 21, `/plugin` 19,
  `/design-login` 7, `/chrome` 4, and 11 more records under six other names. A local command carrying arguments, `/model opus`
  for one, is a control now where it once published.
- The draft from your first prompt is not changed by this. On 550 of 1,601 local Claude sessions
  that first prompt is a control, `/clear` on 326 of them, and skipping it would mean drafting from
  a later record, which the first-prompt read refuses to do. The next section records the ruling.
- Whether a direction may be drafted as your intent is unchanged: the same three-word test as any
  message, so `/create-pr` alone is a direction and not a drafted intent.
- A command's arguments over several lines once published the last line, closing tag and all; 12
  such records in the local store change summary, and 3 local commands with such arguments stop
  being listed. Those facts' ids move. For up to 24 hours after the upgrade the semantic history
  store still holds the old facts, so an old citation resolves to the old row and a retitled
  record can show twice; once the history window ages them out, a citation stored to one no
  longer resolves.
- A command longer than the record reader's 2,000 characters loses its closing `</command-args>`
  (2 of the 1,477 measured). It is published with the arguments that arrived rather than as
  the bare name, and "Add it to my intent" offers them ending in an ellipsis and reports them
  clipped, so the reader edits the line before saving it and it is never offered as whole.

### What the control-first build decided, 2026-10-01

DRC-4766, built to the owner's ruling of the same date: a session whose first prompt is a harness
control drafts no goal, and the page says there is no first prompt to draft from, so the reader
types one.

- No draft at all, not a later one. The latest prompt is a later record, and the first-prompt read
  never drafts from one, so a control-first session does not fall back to it either. Skipping the
  control to the first prompt that states work was the alternative, and the ruling refused it.
- The server decides. `transcripts.first_prompt` publishes `first_prompt_control`, true when the
  first record is a control by `transcripts.harness_control_prompt`, the same rule the goal slot
  and the instruction line read. The page renders that verdict and does not classify the prompt
  itself. `annotations.prompt_candidate` refuses to adopt such a first prompt, so a request built
  by hand cannot save the command as the goal either.
- `first_prompt` still publishes the control, `/clear` or `/compact keep notes`, and session
  history keeps it as before. It is what the session opened with, and the history record is not a
  draft. The new field is a boolean, so it is not prompt text and needs no allowlist entry.
- The page says "This session opened with /clear, so there is no first prompt to draft a goal
  from." in the slot the draft's lede uses, so it costs the fold no row. It names the command and
  not its arguments. The Sessions goal cell shows "Add a goal" over such a session rather than
  the latest prompt, because the cell names what the session page drafts. "Use your prompt" still
  offers the reader's prompts, which the reader chooses rather than receives
  ([amended 2026-10-01](#amended-2026-10-01-use-your-prompt-fills-the-goal-box)).
- Measured over the local store, counts only: 550 of 1,601 Claude Code sessions with a first prompt
  publish it as a control (`/clear` 326, `/login` 115, `/plugin` 36, `/mcp` 24), and 9 of 469
  Codex sessions do. Before, every one of them drafted the command as the goal; now none does,
  and the other 1,051 Claude Code sessions draft as before.

## DEC-26: four drift levels, and a live estimate after every turn

Decided 2026-09-24 (DRC-4691). DRC-4692 defines and validates the levels on recorded Claude Code
sessions. DRC-4696 builds the live estimate in the panel and the header, and amends the skill body's
sentence "Nothing here evaluates on a cadence" when it ships, not before, because the skill body
describes the shipped product.

A reader who glances at a session wants to know how far it has moved from their intent without
pressing anything. The ruling takes option C's four levels as designed, None or low, Medium, High
and Extreme, with a live estimate after every turn and a header pill. The owner accepted these
costs knowingly:

- It amends DEC-15, including its 2026-09-23 amendment, which refused evaluation on a cadence.
- It amends DEC-17 rule 4 (consistent is never rendered as met) and "What the contract does not
  remove": a cadence makes the full rubric owed, and the levels research below is its first
  measured part.
- It amends DEC-20 item 3 (no surface says a session has no drift), its state table, and "What
  DEC-15's indicator sentence now means".
- It amends DEC-23 items 6 and 7: the level is a derived state of the tool-outcome facts, published
  on the session payload only, never on a row, in history or in an off-machine payload.
- It accepts the A9 failure class, a level that reads safe when little is seen, and puts a measured
  basis in front of it.

Six sub-questions were ruled the same day, each as recommended.

1. The basis is a separate rule per source. Each level has a written definition over named
   evidence, and DRC-4692 measures it. "None or low" has a floor for each source. For the live
   estimate: the latest run of every check has a recorded result and passed, nothing was written
   after that pass, no shell command that is neither a check nor on DEC-23's read-only list ran
   after that pass, and, where the saved intent names folders, every write is inside them; it says
   it read checks and file paths, not what the intent says. For an analysis: every outcome line is
   `consistent` on a tool-reported check under DEC-23 item 8, with no departure, and the Goal may
   rest on the session's own account; it says "From the analysis at <time>: each line of your intent
   against the checks and messages it cited." For both: no failed check, and no unsettled later
   direction. A later direction blocks "None or low", and so, for the live estimate, does such a
   shell command; neither is ever counted as drift. A check with no recorded result, and a pass
   before a later write, never count toward it. With too little evidence the level reads "Not
   enough recorded yet", never "None or low". Zero is too little: the live estimate needs at least
   one check whose latest run passed, and an analysis needs at least one outcome line, so a session
   with no check, or an intent with no outcome line, reads "Not enough recorded yet". DRC-4692
   measures what else is too little. A write here is a file-write tool call the transcript
   recorded. A file a shell command changes is not seen (DEC-23's capture), so "nothing was written
   after that pass" means no recorded write, not that nothing changed. The shell-command blocker
   narrows that gap. A read-only command is not read-only when it carries a command substitution,
   a redirect into a file, or a writing option the closed lists name (`find -delete`, `-exec` and
   `-fprint`, `tree -o`, `git diff`/`log`/`show --output`); what is still not seen is a command on
   the read-only list that changes files through anything else.
2. Two sources, labelled. "Live estimate" is computed without a model after each turn, from DEC-23's
   evidence and the reader's saved intent: failed checks, passes followed by writes, and the share
   of writes outside the folders the intent names. An unsettled later direction, and a shell command
   after any check's latest passing run that is neither a check nor read-only, only block "None or low".
   The folder signal is not used when the intent names no folder, so it is never read as 0%. Over
   an unsaved draft there is no live level: the Drift section reads "Save your intent to see a live
   estimate" and the pill is hidden. "Analysis" derives the level from a reading's per-line
   results, with no new model output. Each source says what it is and when it was computed.
3. Where it shows: the Drift section and the session header pill. Not a Sessions row, not a total
   and not a sort key. DEC-20's "Drift" row mark, its table, and DEC-23's no-row-field rule stay.
4. The live monitor switch is off by default, as the design's "Turn on for a quick, low-cost drift
   check after every turn" says. It is remembered per session in the browser only, and never sent
   to the server: there is no server-side store and no new route. DRC-4696 adds its row to
   [the reader-state inventory](design-reader-state.md). Off hides the live level and the pill;
   the analysis level is unaffected. Amended 2026-10-02 (NU-5): the hint reads "Shows a level
   after every turn, from checks and file paths, with no model call", because "low-cost"
   suggested a spend the estimate never makes.
5. No notification, desktop or page, comes from the live estimate (DEC-18, DEC-19). The live
   estimate and the analysis level never make a session eligible for the unasked lane, never
   trigger, order or gate it, and never feed it. The live estimate is not DEC-18's unasked reading:
   it calls no model and raises nothing.
6. History. Neither level is stored. The analysis level is recomputed from the stored reading, and
   "Rose from Medium at #33" from recorded evidence within the run. Each source keeps its own line
   from item 1: the live estimate says it reads checks and file paths, not what the intent says, and
   the analysis says it read each line of the intent against the checks and messages it cited.

DRC-4728 amends that recomputation on 2026-09-29. A stored departure must still have current,
citable evidence inside the reading's window, under the same source, authorship, work and check
rules that accepted the reading. A vanished citation or an aged-out entry cannot keep the level
raised. The server supplies all current facts from the cited session, including the person's
messages that may support a Goal departure; limiting the lookup to check rows would retract those
legitimate departures. This revalidation reads the published facts and calls no model or output
grant.

The owner answered two questions from review the same day, and both answers are part of this ruling
rather than an amendment. A shell command that is neither a check nor read-only, run after any
check's latest passing run, blocks the live estimate's "None or low" and is never drift (item 1, and DEC-23 item
3; the read-only list is in DEC-23's closed lists). The analysis level has its own source line, and
the line "reads checks and file paths, not what the intent says" is the live estimate's alone (items
1 and 6).

### The starting definitions

These are what DRC-4692 validates, not a measured result. Medium: a pass is followed by writes, or
some writes fall outside the named folders. High: the latest run of any check failed, or most writes
fall outside the named folders. Extreme: both hold. "None or low" is the per-source floor in item 1.

### What the levels build decided, 2026-09-24

DRC-4692 built the two functions in `cargento_runtime/levels.py`, and `scripts/levels_cases.py`
to measure them. The ruling left these open. Each was settled on the withholding side, and each is
part of what the owner's marks validate.

- "Both hold" means both of High's conditions: a failed latest run and most writes outside the named
  folders. An analysis reads no folder, so it never reads Extreme. A first draft reached Extreme
  from an analysis when a failure came with departures on most lines. Its own failed-check case then
  read Extreme on a one-line intent, and the rule was one nobody had ruled, so it was dropped.
- A folder is a path-shaped word in the goal or a line: two or more parts joined by `/`
  (`web/app`, `src/components`), a trailing `/` (`server/`, `.github/`), or a leading `./` (`./web`).
  A last part with a dot names its folder instead (`src/retry.py` names `src`, `web/.env` names
  `web`), unless a trailing `/` marks the word itself. A closed list of prose pairs names nothing:
  and/or, either/or, client/server, input/output, read/write, true/false, yes/no, on/off and
  before/after. A bare word and a URL name nothing either. An absolute path inside the session's
  working directory is read relative to it, even with one part left. One outside it stays a named
  folder, and since written paths are published relative to the working directory, no write is ever
  inside it. A review round first refused every multi-part word without a marker, to keep prose out,
  and that made "only touch web/app" name nothing and read lower, so it was reverted to the closed
  list.
- A write outside the working directory counts as outside every folder, and so does a write the
  twelve-entry listing dropped. Review found that counting only the listed writes made the share a
  lower bound reported as the share, so a capped listing could lower the level.
- Layer 1 publishes `changed_after` on each check, from the command order the press already used:
  whether a command that may change files followed the check's latest run, in the same call or a
  later one. The live floor blocks on it. Across calls, a changing command whose recorded time
  equals the pass's is read as after it, because the times cannot say which ran first.
- The live floor also withholds when the scan counts a background launch, because a check only ever
  run in the background is neither listed nor counted (DEC-23 item 1) and the launch count cannot
  tell it from a server. It also withholds when the listed entries cannot place every pass, and
  when the scan is missing any count, which reads as too little rather than as zero.
- An analysis needs at least one outcome line, whatever its Goal says, and a reading whose rows are
  not all objects, or whose keys are not exactly the Goal and `line_1` to `line_N` for the intent it
  read, reads "Not enough recorded yet". An outcome line is shown only by a `consistent` with no
  `why` that cites a passing check. A cited pass that was followed by a change, when read or since,
  reads Medium, as a pass followed by a write does on the live side. The cited pass must also be
  inside the reading's window, as `reading.check_supports` requires. A failed check in the reading's
  window reads High whether or not the reading cited it, and a check with no time counts as inside
  the window. Both window tests read a check by when its result arrived, where one was recorded
  (DRC-4702, 2026-09-27). A failed check before the window still blocks "None or low".
- The case tool takes the marks before any reading exists. Cases are built without readings, both
  levels are marked from the evidence and the intent alone, the digest is committed, and readings
  are attached afterwards, stamped with that commit. The first build showed a stored reading on the
  marking screen, which let the reading shape the key.
- The readings are replayed from the frozen cases, not pressed on a live board (owner,
  2026-09-28). A press on these recorded sessions withholds `idle-unknown`, because no turn stop or
  end was ever observed for them, and a cut case on a live board reads more than was frozen.
  `levels_cases.py --read` hands `reading.produce` the case's frozen facts and intent, with the
  row stopped at the case's own `captured_at`. It goes over the Codex route, charged on the reading
  home's ledger, the count a press uses. The evidence rules, the prompt and every withheld reason
  are the press's, and a withheld case is recorded as refused. On this corpus the readings are not
  spent (owner, 2026-09-28): the dry run's synthetic replies show the evidence alone fixes the
  analysis outcome of seven of the nine readable cases. The
  [replay section](drift-levels/README.md#readings-replayed-from-the-frozen-cases) owns the rest.
- A level passes the owner's mark when it matches or reassures less. "Not enough recorded yet" is
  more cautious than "None or low" only. Said of a case marked Medium or higher, it hides drift the
  owner saw.

### What the live estimate build decided, 2026-09-28

DRC-4696 built the live estimate in the panel and the header. The ruling left these open, and each
was settled on the withholding side.

- The server computes it, not the page. `live_estimate.py` replays the focused session's calls
  through the same tally the record is published from and asks `levels.live_level` after every write
  or shell call, so the level now is the validated function over the published facts and "Rose from"
  comes from the same replay. It is published on the focused project context only, and only when
  the request's project is the session's. The reading route's context, which the unasked lane
  reads, carries none, and neither does a row.
- The replay asks for the level after the last 64 writes or shell calls only. An unbounded replay
  took 24 s on a 3,000-call transcript of targeted checks. A rise older than that window is
  withheld. The replay is held in the server's memory per session and saved words, never written.
  An unchanged parent and child inventory reads no transcript content. A changed inventory gets
  the same bounded scan as the published record. Exact append growth or a safely removable old
  head reuses normalized tally state, while the current window is evaluated again. An unsafe head
  change or uncertain overlap takes the fresh path. Concurrent requests for the same words and
  evidence share one computation.
- The switch is never sent, so the server computes the estimate for the focused session whenever it
  has a saved intent, and the page decides whether to draw it.
- "Rose from <level> at #<n>" is said only when both levels are on the scale and the entry the rise
  came from is still in the record the page numbers. "Not enough recorded yet" is no level to rise
  from, and a call whose entry a later run replaced has no number, so the sentence is left out
  rather than pointed at another entry.
- A level computed against a revision other than the one the panel shows is not drawn.
- The pill shows a level on the scale only. "Not enough recorded yet" stays in the Drift section,
  and the pill is not a link, because the page routes on its fragment.
- The nudge is drawn and never announced: no live region, because the live estimate raises nothing
  (item 5). It is not drawn while an analysis runs, when the level keeps its title and pill, dims
  its meter and drops its detail line, as the design's analyzing state does. Over an unsaved edit to
  saved words the nudge goes too, because Analyze is refused there; the level and the pill stay,
  since they are about the saved words.
