/* A persistent React node keeps its own focus, so most of the legacy focus lane
   has nothing left to do. What remains is the case the node cannot cover:
   the focused control is removed (or replaced under the same key), and focus has
   to land somewhere the reader would expect rather than on the document body.

   Keys sit in a Map and are compared by identity, never interpolated into a
   selector: a key is built from project and session text a hostile payload could
   write, which is what the legacy hostile-key test exists to prove. The old
   target's visibility is read when it is removed, not when focus is restored,
   because by then it is gone. A control wholly outside the viewport is
   restored with `preventScroll`, so an unrelated revision does not drag a reader
   who scrolled away back down to the control they had parked on; one that
   intersected the viewport keeps the browser's ordinary scroll-into-view, so
   the control they were using stays reachable
   ([Document scroll](docs/design-reader-state.md#document-scroll)). */
