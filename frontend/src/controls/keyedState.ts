   press, so it has to outlive the node it was drawn on: the board redraws on
   every revision and a cue held by a node would vanish with it. Held by key
   instead, and stamped, because never expiring is the worse lie of the two: a
   row would read SENT for the rest of the run. 30 s is longer than the 20 s
   idle render, so a cue's life is not decided by when a render lands, and
   short enough that nobody reads it as a property of the session. The cap is
