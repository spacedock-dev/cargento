/* The workstream evidence: what this tab has observed about each project's sessions changing state, plus
   what the server's history store replays for the time before the tab opened. Ported statement for
   statement from the legacy `next-workstream.js` (and the changes half of `nextObservedHistory`), and held
   to it by the differential test. Nothing here reads the DOM, the clock or a store: the evidence is a
   value, and a view that draws it hands it the payload that arrived.

   Two rules survive from the legacy file because a later reader will be tempted to tidy them:
   - A seeded record's LAST stored state closes a span rather than opening one. The store records what
     changed and never when the server stopped, so a final `working` record held to this tab's first
     payload would count a closed laptop as time an agent worked. Evidence is biased down, never invented.
   - Missing history is not zero. A project with no event in the window has an empty list and a caption
     that says how far back the evidence reaches, never a count of nothing. */
