   cannot make a second one: two owners would each hold their own idea of what was already announced, and
   every banner would appear twice. The legacy page's `next-notify.js`, held to it by the differential test.

   Nothing here runs a banner or a request on mount. A banner is created for a transition the board
   published after the first payload it saw (primed), only while this tab owns the browser lane and the
   reader has granted permission; the permission prompt opens only on a press; the lane report is the one
