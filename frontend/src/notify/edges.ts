   rather than stacking a second one.

   WHAT THE QUIET NUDGE CAN AND CANNOT SEE. The native lane fires this off Claude's own `idle_prompt` hook
   event. The browser has no hook, only polled `state`, so this fires on the working to idle edge, which is
   the moment the row crosses `working_threshold_sec` without new activity and not the moment the harness
   declares itself idle. That is near-parity and not parity, taken deliberately: exact parity needs the
   notification kind, which the server drops for the idle types. The title says "has gone quiet", which is
   exactly what was observed, rather than borrowing the gate's stronger sentence. */

     exists to report, on the default install, since both shipped hook manifests declare `Stop`.
     `previous === "working"` is the liveness check instead. Only from `working`: an answered question also
     lands on idle, and the reader was standing right there when it did. An idle row seen for the first
     time is not a transition either, because `previous` is undefined then.
