/* A save drew four GETs and painted on each, so there are three kinds of call.
   `refresh` is a reader's or a write's, and `poll` the boot's and the fallback
   poll's: each fetches at once and supersedes a fetch already out, whose answer
   is dropped, so a hung GET can never hold the board past the next poll.
   `wake` is the stream's and another tab's: it joins a fetch a write or a wake
   has out by queueing one more, and an answer that arrives with a run queued is
   dropped for it, never painted. A wake supersedes a poll's fetch, so a slow
   poll never delays the news. Either way an awaited `refresh()` resolves only
   after a fetch that STARTED AFTER THE CALL has painted: a superseded or
   dropped run hands its waiters on. A failure is counted only by the run that
   is still current, so an older request's failure never marks the board. */
