   so a session pausing between turns (running, then a stop settling for 8 s, then its last turn) never
   closes the button. A candidate that reverts first says nothing. Only the drawn card is tracked: an entry
   not drawn on the pass before is drawn fresh, saying nothing. The legacy page's `nextReadingFlip` is the
