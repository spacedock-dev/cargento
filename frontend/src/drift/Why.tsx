/* Tier 2 of the caveat rule
   ([NUI-19](../../../docs/design-next-ui.md#nui-19-a-caveat-has-three-tiers)): the claim stays inline where the
   reader meets it and the rest goes behind a summary naming what is inside. Open state is the reader's own,
   kept by the disclosure lane under a key made of the project, this session and the control's name, so it
   survives every redraw and opening a caveat on one session never opens it on the next.

   Two fallbacks, because both silently delete a caveat rather than tiering it: an empty body renders nothing
   at all instead of a summary promising text that is not there, and a missing summary renders the body
   inline instead of hiding it behind a control with no label. */
