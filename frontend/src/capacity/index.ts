/* The capacity strip, the usage consent and the observer-model consent controls.

   Wiring, which this step leaves to the shell:
   - the Sessions view draws `<CapacityStrip />` after its groups, as the legacy page does;
   - the Console tab passes `usage={<RailUsage />}` and `observer={<ObserverControls projectKey focus />}` to
     `ProjectConsole`, which places each where the legacy Console did.
   Nothing here fetches on mount: the quota parameter rides a poll only after the reader answers yes
   (`UsageDisclosure`), and a model request starts only on the press of "Summarize this session". */
