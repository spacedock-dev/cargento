/* The project's steering bar. A note to oneself: Cargento has no write path into a session, and the bar says
   so before the first keystroke rather than after the press, because a control that promises delivery
   ("Tell this project what to do next", submit "send") and says nothing about what it does would be believed.

   The box is a native, uncontrolled input held by the project's exact label. What is typed is recorded as it
   is typed and handed back as the box's first words when the route returns, and the caret, the selection and
   the scroll travel through the field memory under the same key, so a redraw, a tab change and a trip to
   another page leave the words, the caret and the undo history where they were. Sending clears the draft AND
   the live node: a node left holding the sentence would be read back as the draft. */
