/* What the previous interface said, recorded, so the React port stays held to it after that interface was
   removed. "Legacy" in this seam, in the `legacy*.test.helper.ts` files and in the differential tests means
   that removed page: its source is gone from the shipped plugin and nothing here reads it.

   Each differential test compares the TypeScript port with the recorded answers of the removed page over
   generated inputs. A harness (`legacyHarness`) is a stand-in for the removed page's functions: calling one
   of its methods looks the answer up in `frontend/test/golden/vitest/<test file>.json.gz`. These files are
   fixtures of record. The page that produced them no longer exists, so they cannot be regenerated; a changed
   generator, input or step fails with the name of the call that has no recorded answer. A deliberate
   departure from a recorded behaviour is an edit to the test that says so, and an entry in the design
   record, never a silent change of input.

   A key is a hash of what the removed page was asked: the harness, the method, its arguments and the state
   the earlier calls left it in. State is tracked as a hash and never read back from a page, so a method has
   to say how it changes state (see `HarnessSpec`). The state returns to where the module left it at the
   start of every test, so a test filtered by name asks for the same keys as it does in a full run.

   The generators stay deterministic (fixed seeds) so a run finds the keys that were recorded. How many cases
   each differential runs is a `CASES` constant in the test: the committed goldens hold a few dozen to a
   hundred generated cases per differential, plus the hand-built edge cases, because the migration's
   thousands of cases proved the port equal once and the goldens only have to keep it so. A rare state the
   first seeds miss is reached by a named witness seed (`seedSample`). A callback handed to the removed page
   stands in a key by its source text, so reformatting one changes the key. The goldens were checked against
   a clock moved 400 days on: nothing in them reads the wall clock.

   Every key a golden holds must be asked for by the end of its test file's run, so a removed or shortened
   differential (a smaller `CASES`, a dropped step) fails instead of leaving recorded answers nothing
   compares. A run that cannot reach them all says so: a name filter (`-t`) skips the check, and a file
   that skips tests on purpose calls `allowUnreadGoldens` with the reason.

   Answers are stored through one codec, so a test cannot pass against a value a golden could not hold. The
   codec keeps what a JSON round trip would hide (`undefined`, `NaN`, `-0`, the infinities, `Set`, `Map`,
   `Date`, `RegExp`) and refuses what it cannot keep (a function). */
