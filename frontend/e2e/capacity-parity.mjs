/*
 * The capacity strip, the usage consent and the observer-model consent in a real browser, against the real
 * backend (DRC-4827, capacity half).
 *
 * The React page runs in Chromium over a synthetic board (`frontend/test/capacity_backend.py`) whose backend
 * counts what matters to a person who was promised a disclosure: the requests that carried `usage=1` to the
 * application and the project-context requests that carried the observer-model consent. A differential then
 * compares what a reader can observe (the strip's rows, the consent controls) with what the previous interface
 * said of the same board, from `frontend/test/golden/e2e/capacity-parity.json` (`support/golden.mjs`), a
 * recording that cannot be remade because that interface is gone. The React page is held to every assertion.
 *
 * Where a loop once ran the same absolute assertions on both pages (a consent that sends no parameter, a selected
 * window that survives a reorder, a layout that fits), the React page now carries each such assertion whole: they
 * state what must hold rather than compare two pages. What is compared with the recording stays: the disclosure
 * sentence, the strip's keys, ticks, sub-limits and wording. Dropped with the previous interface: its overflow
 * measures and keyboard traces, which were only recorded as notes, its screenshots, and, in the development run,
 * its origin standing in as the second origin of "the answer is per origin" (the production run opens the React
 * page at a second origin instead).
 *
 * What a unit test cannot see is proved here: that an unanswered or declined consent sends no usage parameter
 * through a mount, StrictMode, a route change, a reload and a reconnect; that the parameter rides the very next
 * request after a real press and stops at the next one after turning it off; that the answer is per origin;
 * that the selected window survives a redraw that reorders it and a route change; that allowing the observer
 * model sends nothing and that one press of Summarize sends one request for the exact session; that nothing
 * posts, raises a terminal or notifies; and that the layout holds at 320 and 375 CSS px.
 *
 * No model is called, no credential is read and no vendor is contacted: the backend answers from fixed numbers
 * and records the request instead of acting on it. `Notification` is a script that records and shows nothing.
 * Run with `pnpm test:capacity:browser`; `CARGENTO_E2E_STEPS=<regex>` runs only the steps whose name matches,
 * `CARGENTO_SCREENSHOTS=1` writes captures to docs/screenshots/, and `CARGENTO_MUTATION=<name>` applies one
 * deliberate break (see MUTATIONS), which must make the run FAIL.
