"""The answer key for "does a reading know when to say I can't tell".

DEC-17's evaluation needs expected answers written down BEFORE the producer is
pointed at them. A mark written after seeing an output is agreement, not a
mark. This collects those answers. The captain accepted the recorded case review
as sufficient to enable readings on 2026-09-14, and the owner accepted the
Claude Code producer on 2026-10-02 after its scored runs failed; scoring remains
a separate act.

    mark_abstention.py --build      assemble cases from the live board
    mark_abstention.py              mark the unmarked ones, one call each
    mark_abstention.py --report     progress, and the spread of what is marked
    mark_abstention.py --freeze F   freeze a format 5 packet from the spec in F
    mark_abstention.py --freeze F --production-reading
                                   prospectively freeze typed Claude production inputs

The prospective flag admits parent agent excerpts and binds the exact production
selection against a stamped historical source prefix. Whole final replies remain
in memory: packets store digests, and scoring rereads and checks the source.
Adopted goals and request-aged lines refuse this v1 scope. Existing packets are
never upgraded, and this source freeze establishes no accuracy verdict.

## What a case has to put on screen, and why two versions of this failed

Twice, and both times for the same reason: the questions turned on something the
display did not show.

v1 drew cases from the history store, which keeps five fields per observation by
a deliberate allowlist. Every case rendered as a harness and a poll count. Four
identical rows in a row, fifty four questions, and a key marked unanimously
because there was nothing to tell the cases apart.

v2 moved to the live board and showed session metadata: a directive fragment, a
turn percentage, a state. Better, and still wrong. A reading does not read
metadata. It reads the **ledger** -- the `project_context` facts for that
session, filtered to the ones carrying a type, a source and a summary. Two of
six cases still rendered byte identical. The complaint was the same complaint.

So this version fetches the ledger per case and shows it. The question "can it
judge this" is operationally "does that ledger hold anything citable", and that
number is now on screen.

## Three properties, each a decision rather than a preference

**The marker is not the author.** Whoever wrote the producer must not write the
key, or the key records what the code already does. The tool refuses to guess a
mark, has no default, and has no "mark the rest like that one".

**A question with a fixed answer is not asked.** The Expected Output constraint
is only ever put to the model when the record it reads holds work evidence
(`reading.asks_output`), and this tool never grants tool output, so that is a
Pi session with a demonstrated work result. Asking it about any other session is
asking the marker to transcribe a constant, and half of v2's prompts did exactly
that. This reads the producer's own predicate over the case's ledger to know
which cases to skip. That is the producer's **contract**, not its output, and
the two are not the same thing: a tool that knows which questions are asked
cannot thereby agree with an answer.

**A mark is keyed on identity, never on position.** v2 hashed the row's index in
the board's session list. The board reorders on every state change, so a rebuild
silently re-attached answers to different sessions -- measured, four of six. The
key is now a hash of `(harness, sid)`, which is stable, and still carries no
session identity into the file that gets committed.

## What a scorer has to do, written down so it is not discovered later

The two constraints below live in this file, not in the annotation store. A
producer handed a session with no stored revision refuses it outright with
`nothing-typed`, before any evidence is read. So `score_abstention.py` hands
`reading.produce` these two lines as a **synthetic revision**, per case, as an
argument: nothing is written to `cargento-annotations.json`, no reading count
moves, and the Intent log stays the reader's. The first draft of this paragraph
had the scorer write and clear a store revision instead; `produce` takes
`revisions` as a parameter, so that was a write for nothing, and a write into
a file that is the reader's.
