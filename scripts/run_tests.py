"""Run a unittest discovery across worker processes, with unittest's own result.

The CI quality gate ran the dashboard suite single-process on multi-core
runners, six times per pull request. This runner keeps unittest's discovery,
fixtures and verdict, and spreads the work:

- Every worker repeats the exact ``discover`` call the serial command makes.
  That is load-bearing, not tidiness: 29 test modules never import
  ``tests/support.py`` and get their temporary ``HOME`` and ``CARGENTO_HOME``
  only because discovery imports it first. A worker that imported just its
  own modules would run those against the developer's real home.
- The unit of work is a whole test class, so ``setUpClass`` keeps its meaning.
  Classes go into one queue, largest first, and each worker pulls until it is
  empty. Measured 2026-09-23: 131s serial, 33.8s with four workers, with the
  same 3705 tests and verdict. A timings file was tried and gained 0.2s at four
  workers, so the queue orders on test count alone and nothing goes stale.
- Workers are started with ``spawn`` everywhere, which is what Windows does
  anyway, so a pass on Linux says something about the other two.
- ``--coverage`` starts coverage inside each worker with a data suffix; run
  ``coverage combine`` afterwards. Coverage is imported only when asked for,
  because the runtime floor installs no coverage.

Every class is its own top-level run, so ``setUpModule`` runs once per class
rather than once per module. One module defines it, to start and stop a log
patch, which is indifferent to that. And two classes that land in different
workers cannot see each other's leftovers, so an order-dependent failure that
serial ``unittest`` would show every time can pass here; the serial command
still exists for chasing one.

Each worker also reports what its own discovery found, and any difference from
the parent's is an error. Without that, a class a worker failed to import ran
as an empty suite and passed, and a class only a worker found was never run:
three crafted suites went green here and red under ``unittest``.

Usage mirrors ``python -m unittest discover``::

    python scripts/run_tests.py -s cargento/skills/cargento/tests -t .
    python scripts/run_tests.py -s scripts/tests -t scripts/tests -j 4 --coverage
