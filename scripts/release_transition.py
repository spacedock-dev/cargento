"""The Release workflow's decisions, as small functions a test can break.

Usage (each subcommand is one workflow step; see .github/workflows/release.yml):

    python3 scripts/release_transition.py resolve --tag v0.2.0 --github-output "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py assert-head --expected <sha>
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py assert-checkout --mode fresh --target <sha> \
        --verified <sha> --tag v0.2.0
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py bump --tag v0.2.0
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py commit-bump --tag v0.2.0
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py final --mode fresh --target <sha>
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py push-bump | move-tag | advance-stable \
        --tag v0.2.0 --final <sha>
    python3 scripts/release_transition.py rehearse --repo <tmp clone> --tag v0.2.0 --dry-run

The decisions used to be inline shell in the workflow, where nothing could
exercise them: a `exit` inside an awk pipe under `pipefail` once broke resuming and
left a failed run on every release. Standard library only, because the
credential-free `resolve` job runs it before any dependency is installed.

Why the release is split around a target SHA. The frontend is verified (rebuilt and
compared, linted, tested) in a job that holds no credentials, and the version bump
is pushed by a job that holds the deploy key. `resolve` therefore fixes one commit
before anything runs. A fresh release's target is the main tip captured once; a
resumed release's target is the existing release commit. The verified job checks
out exactly that SHA, and the privileged job refuses to publish unless its own
checkout is that SHA, so a main that moved while the frontend was being verified
fails safely instead of publishing a tree nobody verified. Re-running resolves a new
target and verifies it.
