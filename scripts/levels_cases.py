"""The answer key for "does each drift level mean the same thing every time".

DRC-4692 validates the two level functions of DEC-26 against recorded Claude Code sessions. The
owner marks the level each case should get BEFORE any rule is scored against it, and the marks'
digest is committed first, because a mark written after seeing an output is agreement, not a mark.
This follows `mark_abstention.py` and `score_abstention.py`, and keeps their split:

    levels_cases.py --build SPEC   freeze cases from recorded transcripts, under ~/.cargento
    levels_cases.py                mark the unmarked ones, one level per source per case
    levels_cases.py --report       how far through the key you are; scores nothing
    levels_cases.py --read --reading-home DIR [--case ID ...] [--dry-run]
                                   replay the frozen cases through the board's reading producer
    levels_cases.py --score        run both functions against the marks, write the summary

The spec is a local file the owner writes, one entry per case: its kind from the closed set
below, the transcript it is drawn from, an optional `until` (a Unix time; the transcript is cut
there, which is how 74c70a30's failed-check case is frozen before the second turn DRC-4673 gave
it), the intent as a separate yardstick, how many later directions stand unsettled, and an
optional stored reading for the analysis source. Nothing is defaulted: an entry missing the intent
or the direction count is refused, because a default there is the author's thumb on the case.

The cases carry recorded check lines and written paths, so they stay under `~/.cargento`, never in
the repository. What is committed is the marks' digest (`docs/drift-levels/marks-digest.json`) and
the scored summary (`docs/drift-levels/results.json`): case ids, kinds, marks, levels, reason
tokens and outcomes, and never a session id, a path, a command, the intent's words, a fact id or
model prose. SECURITY.md's abstention-check section names this second committed half.

Scoring calls no model. Both functions are pure over the frozen facts, so `--score` spends nothing
and can be re-run; it refuses a pass when the marks no longer hash to the committed digest.

`--read` is the one mode that calls a model, and only on the owner's go-ahead: it hands each
chosen case's frozen facts and intent to `reading.produce` over the Codex route, charged on the
reading home's own ledger, and writes what `--attach-readings` takes. `docs/drift-levels/README.md`
says why it replays rather than presses a live board, and what the replay row is.
