"""Score the reading producer against marks written before it ran.

DEC-17's scoring check requires every case the
captain marked "should abstain" to come back `not verifiable from available
evidence`. `mark_abstention.py` collects the marks. This runs the producer over
the same cases and says, per case and per constraint, what it did.
The captain's accepted case review enables readings separately; this script
continues to report measured outcomes and never substitutes acceptance for PASS.
The owner's acceptance of the Claude Code producer on 2026-10-02 is the same
kind of decision: it opened that producer's gate, and every committed Claude
Code result this script wrote still says `failed`.

    score_abstention.py --report                       where the corpus stands; spends nothing
    score_abstention.py --score --producer claude      run the Claude Code producer once per case
    score_abstention.py --score --producer claude --resume
                                                       re-call only the cases the model failed
    score_abstention.py --probe-argv                   one call to a local stub; writes nothing

`--producer claude` is required to score, and is the only producer that may: no
Codex spend is authorized. A result names the producer, the model, a digest of
the argv, the destination and the CLI it ran under, and goes to its own file,
`docs/abstention/claude-results.json`, or a continuation's own fixed file beside
it. Every model call is charged first to the one ledger `abstention_ledger`
owns, which stops at 28 calls across every run (DRC-4666: the DRC-4758 ceiling
of 23, and the five more the owner authorized on 2026-10-01).

## Two corpora, two files, two questions

The marks file is DEC-17's binary check: judge or abstain, per constraint, on
recorded sessions only. The rubric expectation file is DEC-15's: which of the
five case kinds this is, what result was expected and what it should have
cited, on recorded and synthesised cases alike. They are never merged. Sharing
one file would let a synthesised fixture satisfy a gate written for recorded
sessions, and would let a binary key stand in for an expected judgement.

## What a pair lands in, and why "withheld" is its own column

Each (case, constraint) lands in exactly one of `withheld:<reason>`,
`unparsed`, `abstained`, `judged:consistent` or `judged:departure`. The first
is the one that matters most. Twenty of the twenty three cases on the machine
this was written on have an empty ledger, so the producer refuses them before
any model call. Folding that refusal into "abstained" would report a producer
that never abstains as one that always does, on a corpus that exercised it on
three sessions. A withheld case counts for neither side, is printed apart, and
is why PASS also needs the coverage floor below.

`unparsed` is kept apart from `abstained` for the same reason in miniature:
rule 2's fallback renders the same sentence on the page and is a different
fact, the model said nothing usable.

## What PASS needs

No case marked should-abstain judged; and at least one evidence-bearing,
kind-tagged, recorded case per DEC-15 kind that actually reached the model,
judged per producer: the harness of the producer being scored needs all five,
and the other harness's cases are cross-harness controls whose absent kinds
are reported as not produced (the DEC-17 amendment of 2026-09-27). A run that
names no producer keeps the original floor, both harnesses. A judge mark that abstains is
recorded and does not fail, because over-abstention is the safe direction.
The kind tags come from the rubric file's `recorded` entries, never from the
marks file, which is the captain's and is not altered.

Case format 4 replays the frozen `row_snapshot`, `producer_facts` and
`captured_at` offline. Format 5 adds a per-case `intent`, a goal and outcome
lines scored one constraint each, and a Claude Code case's checks frozen as
they stood at `captured_at` (`tool_output`). The marks bind to that packet before scoring; malformed
snapshots never fall back to today's board. Older formats retain live scoring.

The report never prints one figure for all of this and never uses the word
that would invite one: false reassurance, false alarm, missed departure and
over-abstention are four counts, and extraction (which citations hit, missed
or were extra) is a separate column from judgement.

## What this writes, and what it never touches

Two halves. `~/.cargento/abstention-results.json` stays on this machine and may
carry the withheld reason and the producer's cutoff sentence. The committable
summary carries case ids (sixteen hex characters of a hash), marks, outcomes,
counts, coverage, the sha256 of the marks file as scored, and when. A later
report whose marks no longer hash to that digest says so and refuses PASS.
Replay summaries also hash the cases and rubric and refuse PASS if either moved.

The yardstick, the two constant sentences in `mark_abstention`, is handed to
`reading.produce` as a synthetic revision. Nothing is written to the
annotation store, no reading count moves, and the Intent log stays the
reader's. The disclosure this rests on is written at
[The abstention check](SECURITY.md#the-abstention-check).
