"""Forward one Antigravity lifecycle hook to a running Cargento.

Antigravity's third input contract, and the reason this is not folded into
`event_hook.py`. Three things differ from a Claude or Codex hook, and each one
would be a silent bug if assumed away:

1. **The payload is camelCase.** Antigravity encodes with protojson, so the id is
   `conversationId`, not `session_id`. An adapter reading `session_id` would find
   nothing and post nothing, successfully.
2. **A hook must print a JSON object on stdout.** Not a status line, not an empty
   string: a JSON object. `PostToolUse` and the flat events expect `{}`.
3. **`PreToolUse` output gates the tool, and an EMPTY object is a DENY.** Measured
   on 1.1.19: `{"decision": "allow"}` permits a call, and printing exactly `{}`
   refuses it -- "denied by the pre-tool hook system policy". So the rule this
   script follows is not "emit `{}` to stay harmless"; for `PreToolUse` there is
   no harmless output. **Never register `PreToolUse` here.** This script prints
   `{}` on every path including every failure path, so registering it would deny
   every tool call in every Antigravity session. `PostToolUse` and the flat events
   expect `{}` and are safe, which is why those are the only two shipped.

## What is verified, and what these hooks got wrong for their whole life

**The file must be NAME-WRAPPED, and ours was not.** Antigravity's `hooks.json`
takes a hook *name* as each top-level key, with the event keys one level inside
it, exactly as its own guide shows with `lint-checker` and `safety-gate`. Cargento
shipped the events at the top level instead, so agy rejected the file on every
session -- `cannot unmarshal array into Go struct field .PreToolUse`, then `loaded
0 named hooks from 0 hooks.json file(s)` -- and **these hooks never ran at all**
until the shape was fixed. Measured in
`docs/captures/antigravity/hooks-schema-1.1.19-macos.jsonl`.

Two reasons nothing caught it, both worth knowing before trusting a similar check
again. `agy plugin validate` reports `hooks: N processed` by counting top-level
keys WITHOUT type-checking them, so the malformed five-event file reported `5
processed` and looked accepted; the correct file reports `1 processed`, so the
count going down is the signal it is right. And the failure is invisible outside
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/log/`: nothing surfaces in the TUI.

**What is now measured, on 1.1.19, rather than read from the guide:** the hooks
fire; `PreInvocation`, `PreToolUse` and `PostInvocation` all arrive in one turn;
`conversationId` is present on every payload and `ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID` is
set in the hook process, so both id sources below are real; stdin carries the
payload and closes. `PreToolUse` decisions take effect (see point 3 above). And the relative command
path this plugin ships resolves because agy runs a hook with the installed plugin
root as its working directory, which was measured on the real tree rather than a
probe and had never been tested before.

Still unmeasured: cardinality and ordering across several invocations in one user
turn, which is what the mapping below is deliberately small because of.

## Why so little is mapped

The design's rule for this harness is that its hooks are model, tool and
execution-loop hints, not asserted user-turn boundaries: `PreInvocation` may run
before each model call and one user turn may contain several invocations. Without
a capture proving cardinality, mapping `PreInvocation` to `turn_started` or
`Stop` to `turn_stopped` risks flapping a row mid-turn.

So this sends only `store_changed`, which claims nothing about what the agent is
doing and merely tells the coordinator the store probably moved. Antigravity's
Working and Idle state comes from the status line instead, where `agent_state`
*was* measured. The division is deliberate: hooks give freshness, the status line
gives state, and the hooks are the half that installs with the plugin.
