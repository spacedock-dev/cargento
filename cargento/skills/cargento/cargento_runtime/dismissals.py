"""Dismissals: the sessions the reader has marked handled.

The one thing Cargento writes on the reader's behalf. Every other file it writes
records the instance (`lifecycle`); this one records intent, so it lives outside
the per-port state file and outlives the process that wrote it. See
docs/design-dismissals.md for the keying, the invalidation rule and what a
corrupt or unwritable store does.

A leaf: `config` for the paths and the caps, `records` for the untrusted-input
discipline, `io` for the diagnostic sink. It reads nothing else in the runtime,
which is what lets `aggregate`, `notifications` and `http_api` all consult it.
