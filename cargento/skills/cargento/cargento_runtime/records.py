# Credential shapes
#
# A transcript records what the operator typed, verbatim, and sometimes what they
# typed was a key. Seven distinct live Anthropic credentials sit in the local
# Claude store in ordinary prompt history, and every prompt-derived surface on
# the dashboard — the instruction line, `last_prompt`, `prompt_title`, the
# observer goal, a Codex title — publishes that text. `127.0.0.1` is not the
# exposure; a screenshot is.
#
# The list below was derived rather than guessed, the way `injected_prompt` and
# `harness_control` were, and by COUNTING rather than by reading: every
# transcript file in the local Claude and Codex store, read end to end. Each
# entry carries its occurrence count and the number of files it appears in. Of
# the genuine operator prompts in that store — the gate the instruction line
# already uses — 20 carry one of these, and those 20 are what the dashboard
# publishes today: 18 of 21,116 on Claude and 2 of 1,004 on Codex, re-measured
# 2026-08-27 with the same figure before and after this branch widened the list.
#
# `docs/design-credential-redaction.md` holds the false-positive classification,
# the corpus figures, the two thresholds they set, and every alternative
# rejected here.
#
# Redacted **in place**, keeping the words around the match, because the words
# are the instruction and the point of the line. The marker is deliberately
# visible: an operator who sees `sk-ant-…REDACTED` on their own card learns their
# prompt history holds a live key, which is how a rotation ever happens. A silent
# scrub protects the screenshot and tells them nothing.

_SECRET_MARKER: Final = "…REDACTED"  # noqa: S105 - the marker replaces a secret, it is not one

# `(name, characters of the match kept in front of the marker, anchored, pattern)`.
#
# Every body is bounded above as well as below, and the upper bound is the
# vendor's own longest issued key with headroom rather than a round number. An
# open-ended `{n,}` body is greedy across `-` and `_`, so a key glued to the
# words behind it took the words with it: 85 characters matched and 71 of them
# instruction, on a probe. A run longer than any key that format issues is not
# that format, so the cap ends the match there and the rest of the line survives.
# `docs/design-credential-redaction.md` carries the per-shape lengths.
#
# `anchored` shapes must start a token: without it `dask-<40 chars>` reads as an
# OpenAI key and `mask-ant-…` as an Anthropic one. A hyphen counts as inside a
# token, and that one decision rejects 78 of the 177 `sk-` candidates in the
# local store.
#
# It is checked in the replacer rather than written as a lookbehind on each
# alternative, and that is a measured choice, not a style one: a leading
# lookbehind leaves no literal for `re` to build its first-character skip from,
# and the substitution cost on a 140-character line goes from 21.5 us to 36.5 us.
#
# `pem` and `urlcred` are unanchored because their own first character is the
# separator: a URL credential is always preceded by a scheme, and a PEM header by
# whatever line came before it.

    SQLite column, a vendor's usage endpoint, a hook payload — and the one thing
    they do not agree on is whether the offset is there at all. So the rule is
    stated once, here, and the parsers that need it call this rather than
    `fromisoformat().timestamp()`:

    **An offset-less stamp is UTC.**

    That is a decision about which wrong answer is survivable, and it was made
    against measurement rather than taste (2026-08-06). Every source checked on a
    live machine sends an explicit offset, and every one of them sends `+00:00`:
    Claude and Pi transcript records, Copilot's `assistant_usage_events.created_at`,
    and all four `resets_at` fields on Anthropic's usage endpoint. So a naive stamp
    from any of them would be one of those same UTC values with the suffix dropped,
    and reading it as UTC recovers the right instant.

    `.timestamp()` on a naive datetime does the opposite: it reads the value as
    *server-local*. In UTC+8 that is an eight-hour error in the direction that
    matters most, making a stamp look older than it is — old enough to fall out of
    an activity window and hide a live session, which is the failure this codebase
    treats as the worst kind.

    Display is unaffected and stays local: `sessions.format_reset` and
    `lifecycle` both `.astimezone()` an epoch value for rendering. This function is
    about reading an instant, not about showing one.

    `Z` is normalized because `fromisoformat` rejected it before Python 3.11 and
    the floor is 3.11; keeping the substitution costs nothing and documents the
    spelling vendors actually send.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Harness-injected prompts
#
# A "user" record is not the same thing as an operator instruction. Every
# harness writes its own machinery into that channel — skill bodies, hook
# feedback, compaction summaries, subagent notifications — and a reader that
# treats those as things a person said reports the wrong goal, the wrong stage,
# and the wrong idea of who is waiting on whom.
#
# The lists below were derived rather than guessed, and
# `scripts/derive_prompt_shapes.py` is the code that derived them — kept, so a
# reviewer can re-run it against their own store rather than take these on
# trust. Every count below is one of its outputs, re-derived 2026-08-27; every
# entry carries one, and nothing without one is here.
#
# **Which records were counted**, because the two halves count different ones:
#
#   Codex   458 `rollout-*.jsonl` files. The user set counts LEADING tags over
#           the union of two populations — 1,007 `event_msg`/`user_message`
#           texts and 1,734 `response_item` message texts with `role: "user"`.
#           A union rather than a choice because the record shape moved mid-CLI,
#           and it DOUBLE-COUNTS: a build that writes both spells one prompt
#           twice, and 974 of the 1,007 `event_msg` prompts have a matching
#           `response_item`. So these are occurrences of a shape, not prompts.
#   Codex   1,826 `response_item` message texts with `role: "developer"`, for
#           the developer set below.
#   Claude  211,669 user-role texts across 3,774 transcripts matching the
#           collector's own glob.
#
# A live store only grows, so re-running the script produces slightly larger
# figures than these. What has to keep holding is the SHAPE of each claim — which
# tag leads, which never does, which population a count is over — not the digits.
#
# The two harnesses do not share a vocabulary, which is why there are two sets
# rather than one. Codex spells its injections with underscores
# (`<recommended_plugins>`) and Claude with hyphens (`<local-command-caveat>`);
# only five names appear in both. An unmeasured harness gets the union, because
# there is no evidence to narrow it and every name in either set is machinery no
# operator opens a prompt with.

# `<image>` is a WRAPPER, not a rejection. All 36 Codex records that open with
# one carry real operator text after it, so rejecting on the tag would drop
# genuine prompts. Claude spells the same thing in plain text, in three
# populations that behave differently and were once counted as one:
#
#   `[Image: source: /path/…]`  387 records, 387 of them nothing but markers
#   `[Image source: /path/…]`   9 records, all 9 nothing but markers
#   `[Image #1]`                135 records, 134 carrying operator text after it
#
# The first two reach the empty-after-stripping rejection; the third is why this
# is a wrapper at all, and why the separator is a character class rather than a
# literal colon — `#` follows a space, not a colon. The attribute matcher is
# loose because Codex writes `name=[Image #1]` unquoted, spaces and `#` and `]`
# included.

# Lexicon of low-content tokens that appear in prompts that carry no work.
# Extracted from 293 hand-reviewed distinct short prompts in a corpus of 3,774
# Claude transcripts and 458 Codex rollouts, measured 2026-08-27. Words that
# appeared ONLY in "bare continuations" — prompts where the operator told the
# agent to proceed without stating new work — were kept; words that appeared in
# ANY contentful short prompt were rejected, which eliminated false positives like
# "ready" (contentful: "ready to review PR #123") and "run" (contentful: "run the
# integration tests").
#
# A prompt reads as a bare continuation when ALL its tokens (first line only,
# lowercased, stripped of punctuation) appear in this set AND it contains ≤8
# tokens. Both conditions are required: "better" alone would reject prompts about
# code changes, and "better this way than that way" would accept a pasted quote
# that names a choice. The 8-token cap is the one threshold set by data: 924 of
# 925 mid-flight continuation prompts have ≤8 tokens; 402 contentful prompts
# exceed it, with the shortest at 9.
#
# Char counts and word counts alone were measured and rejected: <40 chars would
# replace 402 good lines to fix 81 bad ones. The vocabulary replaces 81 bad ones
# and 9 good ones (98.9% precision, 91.2% recall among the hand-reviewed set).
