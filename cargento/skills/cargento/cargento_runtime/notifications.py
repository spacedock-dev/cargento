    Writing that key would put a question in front of every gate on the machine
    for `global_popup_cooldown_sec`, and the two lanes answer different questions

    nothing ever re-registers a question and the sweep deletes it unanswered at

    asymmetry predates the fix and outlives it.)

    reads no dismissal store — so suppressing the alert would leave the reader an
    alert and a board that disagree. (A caller *can* send an 8-character
    `session_id` that would match a Claude mark, so this is a decision about the
