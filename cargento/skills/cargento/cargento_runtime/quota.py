"""Quota acquisition: the outbound fetch, the pushed-in receipts, and the cache.

Two sources fill one cache, and collectors read it back without caring which
filled it.

**The fetch** is the whole of Cargento's outbound network surface, and it is
bound by the "Usage quota reads" section of SECURITY.md: each request carries
the vendor's own OAuth token and nothing else, the token is never refreshed,
never written, never logged and never served, and at most one request per
vendor leaves every five minutes. A violation of any of those is a security
bug, not a defect. Diagnostics emitted here are fixed category words plus
exception type names for that reason — never a value read from a credential
source or a response.

Two vendors fetch: Claude and Cursor. Each gets its own credential reader,
endpoint and response parser, and its own pair of gates, so a vendor that is
slow or broken cannot delay or suppress the other's refresh. `FETCH_VENDORS`
is the whole list, and every endpoint in it is named in SECURITY.md.

**The receipts** are the opposite direction and involve no credential at all.
A harness that publishes its own quota to a user-configured command can have
that forwarded to `POST /api/usage`, and `receive_statusline` shapes what
arrives. Antigravity works this way. Nothing here reaches the network, so the
receipt path is outside the fetch contract above, but it inherits the rule
that only derived scalars are published: the shaping code builds a fresh
entry rather than passing a payload through, because these payloads carry an
account email that must never reach `/api/data`.

    **The published shape.** An entry's existing quota fields are named window
    slots — `fiveH`, `week`, `month` — whose meaning the page knows in advance.
    Per-model limits are not that: they are a list of unknown length whose rows
    are labelled by the vendor, so no slot can hold them and minting `weekOpus`
    and `weekSonnet` beside the others would put this repository in the business
    of tracking Anthropic's model line-up in a frontend table. The field is
    therefore a list of its own:

        models: [{label, pct, reset, resetAt}, ...]

    `label` is the vendor's display name, bounded to `MODEL_LABEL_CAP_CHARS` and
    guaranteed to differ from every other label in the list — see
    `_distinct_labels` for why that guarantee is the point rather than a nicety.
    `pct` is an integer percent on the same scale as every other bar on the
    band. `reset` and `resetAt` come as a pair from `sessions.reset_fields` and
    are present only when the vendor sent a stamp. The list is absent rather
    than empty when there is nothing to say, exactly like the window slots, and
    it is capped at `MAX_SCOPED_LIMITS` rows.

    Rows are ordered by label, which is the one field on a row that does not
    tick. Ordering on `pct` would move rows under the reader between polls, and
    the vendor's own order is nowhere documented to be stable, so inheriting it
    would make the order a coin flip that only shows up as flicker. The sort
    runs after the labels are made distinct, since that is the step that decides
    what a label finally says.

    **Only `weekly_scoped` elements are read, on purpose.** The list also carries
    a `session` element and a `weekly_all` element, and those two are the same
    figures the top-level `five_hour` and `seven_day` objects already publish.
    Those stay the canonical source for the two named windows, so a list that is
    parsed and then only partly consumed is the intended outcome here rather than
    an oversight.

    **`is_active` and `severity` are deliberately not read.** Both are in the
    capture and neither has established semantics. `is_active` **moves**: the two
    recorded readings a day apart disagree about which element carries it, so it
    describes something that varies rather than the kind of limit, and a renderer
    keyed on it would call the 5h window the live constraint one day and the
    weekly one the next with nothing to say which was right. `severity` is a
    vendor-computed enum
    of which only `normal` has ever been observed. Publishing a field the page
    cannot honestly render is how that guess would get made downstream, so they
