"""Copied corrections: a correction the reader copied, recognised when it comes back.

Item 9 of
[DEC-24](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
(DRC-4678). `POST /api/correction/copied` records the digest of the exact text the reader
copied and where the session's transcript ended at that moment; a later Claude Code user message,
written past that point, whose raw text has the same digest is Cargento's words, `derived`, for
adoption, rule 7 and the later-direction floor alike. Only digests, positions and fact ids are
stored, never the text.

The digest is computed here by re-reading the transcript from where the copy was made, rather
than inside the collector: the collector's module is frozen with the abstention qualification
(`scripts/mark_abstention.py`, `_PARSER_FILES`), and this read runs only for a session that holds
a copy. Once a message is recognised its fact id is written to the store and published from there,
so what the tail no longer holds stays recognised.
