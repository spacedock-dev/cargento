# median 350 KB outside the bounded tail (DRC-4264); Claude publishes a title
# generated once from the opening prompt and never refreshed, which names
# finished work on three long sessions in four (DRC-4266). The answer to both is
# one labelled second line, built here so the two readers cannot disagree about
# what it may say.
#
# The rule, and every clause of it is load-bearing:
#
#   the newest GENUINE prompt states work  -> that, labelled "asked"
#   it is a bare continuation ("proceed")  -> the agent's own turn-start
#                                             statement of intent, labelled
#                                             "agent"; else the newest older

# a wrong value there does not merely mislead, it permanently masks the project
# name that would otherwise show. A confident wrong line is worse than a blank.
#

# survivable: "agent" says an agent said this about itself, "earlier" says this
# is not the newest thing asked. Without one, the same text is a claim the
# runtime cannot support, which is why `records.instruction_line` refuses to

    The narrowing below costs some of that reach and is kept anyway: requiring
    `phase == "commentary"` on the item takes it from 87 files to 79, because an
    unphased `AgentMessage` is the final answer rather than a statement of
    intent, and publishing one under an "agent" label would quote finished work

    Both denominators above count RELEASE builds, and the distinction is load
    bearing rather than pedantic: fold the 0.145.0-alpha prereleases back in and
    the older figure falls to 296 of 357 (82.9%), because `phase == "commentary"`
    reached 1 of 51 alpha files. A prerelease is the one population where the

    neither build a person runs.

    The user record split the same way — `event_msg`/`user_message` is gone by
    0.149.1 and `response_item`/message/user is in all but one rollout — and
    0.149 adds a third, `item_completed` with a `UserMessage` item. That third is
    read for the shape rather than for its reach: it appears on 26 files and is

    only when the walk actually reached this turn's `task_started`; otherwise the
    ladder falls through to a labelled older prompt rather than presenting a
    previous turn's intent as this one's.

    `reached_floor` alone does not carry that guarantee, and reading it as though
    it did was the bug: it proves only that SOME turn opened behind the walk, not

    walk run past the newest prompt, overwrite the preamble with the PREVIOUS
    turn's commentary, and then set the floor on that turn — publishing a
