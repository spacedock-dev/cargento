"""The session ends this board observed, kept so a restart does not forget them.

DRC-4547. The end mark is set by the very `session_ended` event that pops a
session's overlay ledger, so it was held on the coordinator outside that ledger
and nowhere else. Measured 2026-09-11: three Claude sessions published
`session end observed` on a board that had been up while they ran; the board
was restarted and the same three came back as `went quiet, no end observed`,
with no way to recover the distinction. The end is the one fact
[DEC-15](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-15-the-floor-and-the-overlay)
requires before a reading may call itself final, so on a restarted board no
final reading could be taken on any session that finished before the restart.

Not the history store, for the reason `deliveries` also declined it: its
contract writes only what the board already publishes, and by the time a cold
row is read there is no `ended_at` on it to write. Not the whole overlay
either. An overlay is a live reduction meant to be rebuilt; what has to survive
is one value per session id, with when.

A leaf shaped on `departures`, lock and per-thread temp name included:
`config` for the path and caps, `records` for the untrusted-input discipline,
`io` for the diagnostic sink. It reads nothing else in the runtime, which is
what lets `observation` write it and `aggregate` read it without an edge
between those two inverting.

## What may be said, and what may not

A record is an end THIS BOARD observed, on the event the harness sent. Absence
is NOT OBSERVED and never "did not end": a session that ended while no board
was running, a harness with no event adapter and a run under `--no-events`
all leave the same nothing here, exactly as they do in the coordinator's
memory. Nothing in this module infers an end from anything but a stored one.

The coordinator is the only writer. `--diagnose` builds no coordinator and so
never writes; `--no-events` builds none either, and the collection then reads
nothing back (decisions.md, DRC-4547: Option A), so that flag switches this
store off in both directions the way it already switches off focus. `--forget`
deletes the file, because a durable end is exactly the class of thing that
command removes: the machine's memory of what it observed.
