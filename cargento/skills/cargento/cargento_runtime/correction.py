"""Steer back's correction, composed without a model (DRC-4681).

Item 7 of
[DEC-24](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-24-your-intent-is-a-drafted-goal-and-a-checklist-and-a-correction-is-yours-to-copy)
fixes the fields: the goal, each outcome line with its state, and the cited entries' times. The
owner approved the template on 2026-09-28 as exact text, and ruled that the server writes each
entry as a placeholder the page fills with "#n" from its own numbering or drops, because a number
is recomputed on the page and never stored (item 11). So nothing here reads a summary, a command, a
check name, tool output, a reading's detail or a message's words: a fact contributes its time and
its id, and the id travels only inside a placeholder. One exception, by the owner's delegation of
2026-10-04: a claim of the agent's that the record contradicts or does not show is quoted by its
message's published title, the first sentence the activity list already shows, and never by the
words a reading read.

`compose` is pure. The route hands it the session's published row, its observed record and the
later-direction floor (`annotations.direction_floor`), and it answers the parts or why there are
none. A line's state is re-derived from the stored reading against the record as it stands now,
with the page's rules for whether a verdict survives (`nextCockpitReadingCriterion`), so the text
never claims a departure the panel beside it has demoted.
