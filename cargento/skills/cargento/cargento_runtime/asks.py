"""Outstanding questions a session asked, and their one-slot answer mailboxes.

A mailbox holds one outcome, not a queue: a question is answered, declined or
expired exactly once, and the first of those to land is the one the asking
session gets. Nothing here can revise it. A declined ask that could later read
as answered would hand an agent a choice the reader never made.

The answer is an index into the options recorded at registration, never a
string. An out-of-range index is refused rather than clamped, so the worst a
forged answer can do is choose the wrong one of the options the session itself
offered. `SECURITY.md` owns that contract.

This module imports nothing from the runtime, which is what lets `state` own the
registry while `http_api` and `aggregate` serve from it without a cycle, exactly
as `stream` does. The consequence worth knowing at the call site: it cannot
reach `records.safe_text`, so every caller must bound the untrusted question and
option text before handing it over. That happens at the HTTP ingress.

    out under it. Reading an outcome does take an ask's condition under the
    table lock, which is safe because the order only ever runs that way: nothing
    holding an ask's condition calls back into the table.

    The same one-way rule reaches outside this module and is the reason the wake
    seam in `observation` is safe. `Observation._due` reads `count` while holding
    `Observation._lock`, so that is the order: `Observation._lock`, then this
    lock, then an ask's condition. Nothing here may ever call into `Observation`,
    and `Observation.note_ask` must therefore be called after `register` has
    returned, with no lock from this module held.

    budget counts only what could still need a slot, because the alternative was
