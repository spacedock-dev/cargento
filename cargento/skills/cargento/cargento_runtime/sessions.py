    segments keep sibling worktrees apart without pasting a whole path into
    the row.

    Separators are the host's, via ``ntpath``/``posixpath``, never a hand-rolled

    ``\\`` is a legal POSIX filename character, so splitting on it turns one

    on the machine it runs on, so the host's own rules are the correct ones.
