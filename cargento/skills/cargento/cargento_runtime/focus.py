"""Raise the terminal a session is running in: one socket case, or no focus.

`SECURITY.md`'s "Reaching a session's terminal (the focus command)" is the
contract this module implements, and its bounds are the operator's ruling of
2026-09-05 as amended rather than this module's preferences. A leaf: it imports
no runtime module and holds no state, so the coordinator can call it from a
handler thread without ordering concerns, exactly as `git_status` is called.

## Why there is one case and not three

DRC-4382 measured which identifier finds a terminal and never raised one; the
capture says so in its own words, that the lookup counts a tab and never
activates one. DRC-4385 then measured a raise, and only over a UNIX socket, where
macOS consults no responsible process at all. The Apple Event arm that decides
the shipping case — a daemon whose launching terminal has been quit — is
inconclusive: its two responsible-identity fields never reached the record. The
contract gates every Apple Event case behind that arm, so this module names none,
and a socket raise changes what a tmux client displays without bringing a GUI
window forward.

## Why the target is half stored and half resolved

The stored half is the socket, the pane, and the pid of the tmux server that
reported them, which a hook gathered from its own environment and posted through
an authenticated event. The volatile half — the tmux session that pane belongs
to, and the device of the client attached to it — is asked for at the raise and
never cached, because a client device demonstrably moves inside one session:
detach and reattach from another tab and it is a different device, while both
readings still mask to `ttys###`.

## Why the server pid is stored beside the pane

A pane id is an ordinal on one tmux server, not a name. Kill that server and
start another on the same socket name and `%3` is somebody else's pane, in
somebody else's session, with nothing about the stored target able to tell the
difference — reproduced on tmux 3.7c, where a second generation re-issued
`%0..%3` and the raise moved a client onto an unrelated window and returned
true. `$TMUX` is `<socket path>,<server pid>,<session id>` and the hook already
has it, so the pid rides along and the first lookup asks for `#{pid}` beside the
session name. A pid that does not match the one that reported the pane is a
decline, which costs no extra command. The same check is what makes a `-L` name
resolving in a directory the hook never validated a decline rather than a raise
on another server's pane: the name may collide, the pid does not.

## What the lookups read, and what is never read back

The two lookup commands' standard output is read, held to a grammar, used to
build the next argv, and dropped. Nothing from them is stored, published or
logged: no pane content, no window title and no pathname enters Cargento's state,
and the raise command's own output is discarded unread. The published answer is a
single boolean, minted by the caller from this function's return value.

## Three declines on the client lookup, and the third is not about the target

Zero attached clients means nobody is watching. More than one live candidate is
ambiguous, and picking one would be the misdirected raise DRC-4382 measured from
the other direction. More than one attached client is refused even when the
target is correct and unambiguous, because `switch-client` resolves the pane to
its window and moves the tmux *session's* current window, which every attached
client displays — measured in DRC-4385's both positive arms and reproduced
outside them. That decline is about who else is watching rather than about
whether the target was found.
