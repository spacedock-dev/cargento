"""The published dashboard snapshot: one built response per variant, versioned.

The revision is a pair, not an integer. A counter alone restarts at zero with
the process, so a tab frozen at revision 512 across a dashboard restart would
treat every later revision as older and never refetch again. Pairing it with
the server start stamp makes a restart visibly discontinuous, and a client
discards its cursor when the first element changes.

The counter is per process rather than per variant, so it orders every
published state a client could hold a cursor against.
