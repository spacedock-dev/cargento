"""What became of each notification Cargento raised.

The first precondition of
[DEC-18](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-18-an-unasked-reading-is-permitted-and-gated-on-delivery-first),
and the one it kept as a build gate: a raise that records no delivery outcome is
exactly the defect the review view exists to show. Measured before this
existed, nothing recorded a raise at all. The only trace was
`state.last_popup`, a cooldown floor held in memory, one float per key
and overwritten on every raise, so a signal that never left the machine and one
handed to the operating system left the same mark.

Named for the outcome rather than the event, because `raise` already means
something else on this board: the control that switches a terminal to a session.

A leaf, shaped on `dismissals`: `config` for the paths and caps, `records` for
the untrusted-input discipline, `io` for the diagnostic sink. It reads nothing
else in the runtime, which is what lets `notifications`, `aggregate` and
`http_api` all consult it.

## Durable rather than in memory, and that is the decision

An outcome held on `RuntimeState` would be the defect [DRC-4547] recorded one
layer over: an observed session end lived only in the memory of the process that
saw it, so a restart made every finished session look like it merely went
quiet (`ends` now carries it across). The read here is deliberately later than
the write, because the whole
framing is that you walked away and came back, and a restart in between is the
expected case rather than an edge. An in-memory record would also make the
sentence for "no record" fire for every raise before the last restart, and that
sentence must mean "this predates the record" rather than "this board forgot".

Not session history: `history.appended` keeps one transition per `(harness,
sid)` and skips an unchanged row, so two raises on one session collapse into
one and an outcome settled later is not expressible. Not the annotation store:
its `_record` refuses a session nobody annotated, and a raise fires on every
active row.

[DRC-4547](https://linear.app/recce/issue/DRC-4547)

## What may be said, and what may not

Four outcomes, one sentence each and never a shared one, which is
`reading.WITHHELD`'s rule for the same reason: folding causes together makes the
least true of them read as the most reassuring. A fifth sentence covers a raise
this store has no record of, and it says so rather than saying undelivered.

Nothing here claims a person saw anything. `osascript` exiting zero means the
scripting bridge accepted the call; it exits zero under Do Not Disturb and with
the hosting application's notifications switched off. That is the whole reason
`HANDED_TO_OS` is worded the way it is.

Two further sentences report the browser lane, under
[DEC-19](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-19-the-page-may-report-a-lane-never-a-delivery):
the page may say whether a notification lane exists in it, and may never
report a delivery. The
negative one says no lane has been REPORTED since a moment, never that the raise
did not reach the reader, because a tab that opens sends a report and a tab that
closes sends none, so absence is stale in one direction only.
