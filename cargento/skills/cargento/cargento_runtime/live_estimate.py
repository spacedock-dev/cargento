"""The live drift estimate for one Claude Code session, replayed without a model (DRC-4696).

Items 2 to 6 of
[DEC-26](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-26-four-drift-levels-and-a-live-estimate-after-every-turn).
`levels.live_level` is the estimate; this module feeds it. It replays the session's calls through
the same tally `project_context.claude_tool_reports` publishes from, one call at a time, and asks
for the level after each of the last `LIVE_REPLAY_STEPS` calls that can move it, so the level now
is the one the published record gives and "Rose from <level> at #<n>" comes from the same record.
The replay is held in this process's memory, keyed by the parent and delegated transcript
inventory and the saved words. Nothing is written, and no model or process is started.

The route publishes the answer on the focused session's project context only (`http_api`), never
on a Sessions row, in history, or in the reading route's own context, which is what the unasked
lane reads (items 3 and 5). Whether the reader has the switch on is never sent to the server
(item 4), so this runs for the focused session whenever it has a saved intent.

It reads the same private check scan, result pairing and call order as `project_context`'s
published tally. That file is in DRC-4666's qualification digest, so edits here require a fresh
qualified run before an unqualified frozen-case result is used as evidence.
