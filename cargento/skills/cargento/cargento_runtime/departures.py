"""Every unasked check Cargento ran, and what each one found.

[DEC-18](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#dec-18-an-unasked-reading-is-permitted-and-gated-on-delivery-first)
permits an unasked reading and adds one amendment this module exists for: every
raise persists the annotation revision and the evidence cutoff it rested on. By
the time the reader comes back the annotation may be at a later revision and the
evidence window has moved, so a raise that does not carry its own baseline cannot
be understood on return.

EVERY check, not only the ones that found something, and that is the correction
rather than the obvious shape. A check that found nothing still spent a `codex`
subprocess at `reasoning_effort=max` against the reader's own capacity, and a
store of raises alone bounds nothing: measured on the raises-only version, five
healthy sessions ran 480 subprocesses in a simulated day against a daily cap of
12, because no reading ever advanced the count. It is also the only way the
board can say whether THIS session was checked, as against whether the lane was
switched on.

A check with no `constraint` is one that raised nothing. A check with one is a
departure, and only those render.

Durable, for `deliveries`' reason and one of its own: the whole framing is that
you were away, so the read is later than the write by design and a restart in
between is the expected case rather than an edge.

A leaf, shaped on `deliveries`: `config` for the paths and caps, `records` for
the untrusted-input discipline, `io` for the diagnostic sink. It reads nothing
else in the runtime, which is what lets `unasked`, `aggregate` and `http_api`
all consult it.

## The lock is not optional here

`deliveries` shipped this shape without one and lost records: an unlocked
read-modify-write with three threads reaching it, plus a temp name shared by
every thread in the process. Measured there, two barrier-synchronised writers
lost a record in 60 of 60 trials. This module has the lock and the per-thread
temp name from its first commit rather than after the same measurement.

## What may be said, and what may not

Only a departure is ever stored, because only a departure is ever raised. The
ruling at the top of this file refuses an unasked `consistent`: an unasked
reassurance is the output the evidence-floor ruling called most damaging, and it
has no value at all to someone away from the desk.

Nothing here is a rate. A count of departures on one session identifies a
session worth reading; it establishes nothing about whether the brief was poor,
the agent was poor, or Cargento's own judgement was poor, and those three are
not separable from the number.

Nor is anything here permanent against the reader's own withdrawal. A raise
quotes the clause they typed, so clearing an annotation blanks the quotations
from the rows those words were read against and keeps the row for its spend.
`withdraw` carries the whole reasoning.

    `constraint` empty is a check that found nothing to raise. It is still a

    `revision`, `cutoff` and `cutoff_text` are the first amendment of the ruling

    what it read. All three are recorded at check time and never re-derived,

    `cutoff` is the moment the reading ran, which BOUNDS the evidence from above

    instant. It is not a second, comparable number -- both producer write sites
    record the same clock into it and into `at` -- so nothing here may compare
    two rows' cutoffs and report what one of them read. `cutoff_text` is the
