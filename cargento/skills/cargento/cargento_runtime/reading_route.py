"""Who reads a session, and the words a reader sees before pressing.

One resolver for the page, the reading route and the stamp, so the provider a
reader was told about is the provider that runs. It is pure except for
`shutil.which`: it never starts a model, and it reads each provider's gate
before looking for its CLI, so a gated provider is never even looked up.

A route depends only on the session's harness and on this machine, never on
the session, which is why the reading route can resolve one from the payload's
harness without confirming that a session exists.
See [DEC-21](docs/design-reading-a-session.md#amended-2026-09-23-claude-code-is-built-and-gated).
