"""Let an agent ask the operator a question and wait for the answer.

A stdio MCP server exposing one tool, ``ask_operator(question, options)``. The
question is registered with the running Cargento dashboard over loopback, the
reader clicks an option there, and the chosen option is returned to the agent.
The harness holds the tool call open for the whole wait, which is measured on
Claude Code 2.1.239 and codex-cli 0.146.1 (see
``docs/captures/{claude,codex}/mcp-ask-gate-*.jsonl``).

## The promise

**Exactly one valid JSON-RPC object per request, on every path.** This is a
stronger promise than the lifecycle forwarders beside this file make, and the
reason is that a caller is waiting: `notify_hook.py` can post nothing and exit 0
because nothing is blocked on it, whereas an agent parked in a `tools/call` is
blocked until this process answers. So there is no silent path here. Every
failure, including no dashboard running, a refused connection, a 503, a
cancellation and an unhandled exception in the worker, resolves to an ordinary
tool result that declines. Never a JSON-RPC error for a call, never a non-zero
exit, and nothing but JSON-RPC frames on stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr.

That promise is kept even for a request the client has cancelled. MCP says a
receiver SHOULD NOT answer a cancelled request, and this server answers anyway:
a late frame on a dead id is discarded by every client, while a missing one can
hang a client that cancelled on its own timeout, and "one object per request" is
the invariant that makes this stdout auditable at all.

## The security property

The dashboard records the options at registration and answers with an **index**.
This process returns ``options[index]`` from the list it registered, never from
anything the dashboard echoes back, and range-checks the index against its own
list. A forged or confused answer can therefore only pick the wrong one of the
options the agent itself offered, and can never introduce text into an agent's
context. `docs/design-ask-lane.md` records why an index rather than a string.

The list it registered is also the list the operator saw. Bounding happens once,
in ``_arguments``, so the string handed back is character for character the label
on the card that was clicked: nobody can approve text that was never shown.

## Why three threads

A reader thread owns stdin, the dispatch loop routes frames, and each
`tools/call` runs on its own worker with a lock keeping every emitted frame
atomic. One sequential loop could not service a `notifications/cancelled` or a
`ping` while a call was outstanding, and would serialize two asks in one turn
into a double wait. The reader is separate from the loop so the loop can wake on
a timeout and notice a stdout that has gone away, which it could not do while
parked in an uninterruptible ``readline``.

Usage, with an optional port to prefer over what the state files publish:

    python3 <skill-dir>/mcp_server.py            # discover the dashboard
    python3 <skill-dir>/mcp_server.py 9999       # prefer port 9999
