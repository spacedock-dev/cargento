"""What the departure store says about a raise, and about what came after it.

DRC-4514. Two things live here that the store alone did not answer before.

The four why-sentences moved down from `unasked.published`, because the review
surface and the Intent log both need them and neither may reach the lane: one
owner, so a spent cap cannot be worded one way on the session page and another
way where the reader reviews it.

The follow-up sentence is derived from later CHECKS in this same store rather
than from a second model call. That is what makes it affordable, and it is also
the only evidence available: a reader-requested reading carries its evidence
cutoff as a producer's sentence and not as a number, so nothing on it can be
compared with a departure's cutoff.
