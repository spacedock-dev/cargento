"""The press check and the job agree on what an Allow covers (owner, 2026-10-02).

"Bind the allow to the destination": an Allow for the reader's words covers a
press only while the provider's destination is exactly the one the Allow's
disclosure named. Two places decide it, and each row of one table is put to
both, after a restart, on a machine whose environment the row names:

- the press handler, over a socket (`http_api._reading_permission`);
- the job, at the reservation (`reading_policy.GuardedModel`).

The page reads the destination the board publishes and asks for an Allow when it
moved; that half is checked on the React side, against the same published route.

A Pi session read by Claude Code, so no tool-output grant is involved and the
words' own binding is the only rule that can refuse.
