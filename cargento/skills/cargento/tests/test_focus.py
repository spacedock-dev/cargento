"""The focus command: what it runs, what it refuses, and what it never reads.

SECURITY.md's "Reaching a session's terminal (the focus command)" is a contract
written and reviewed before this code existed, and its violation sentence is what
this module turns into oracles. Two bounds a green suite misses most easily get
their own classes, and both are named in `test_git_status.py`'s own reasoning:

- **Fixed-position substitution.** A constant argv proves nothing about the call.
  Two different targets must produce argvs differing at exactly one index and
  equal everywhere else, which is what separates substitution into a slot from
  concatenation into an argument.
- **Refused readings.** DRC-4382 measured that for a session with no controlling
  terminal at all, both obvious readings — the first ancestor holding a tty, and
  an emulator variable being set — report a terminal, *and it is somebody else's*.
  So the resolver never reads either, and that is asserted against the source
  rather than trusted, because nothing about a passing raise would reveal it.
