"""The coarse probe's mutation corpus and its cost budget.

This module is the Phase 2 coarse-probe gate from
`docs/plans/event-driven-session-observation.md`. The gate says: do not use the
probe to reduce scans until its mutation corpus has no false negatives on
supported local filesystems, and its cost passes on all three OSes.

Every case below is a real filesystem mutation performed against a real
temporary store, not a mocked stat. The one documented false negative has its own
test asserting it is still exactly that, so widening or narrowing the watched set
cannot change it silently.
