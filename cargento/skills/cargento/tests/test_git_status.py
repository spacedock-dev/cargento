"""The end-of-session git probe: what it runs, what it refuses to do, what it publishes.

The two behavioural tests here are DEC-3's measurement turned into an oracle. They
build real repositories and run the real `git`, because the hazards both flags
disarm are properties of git rather than of this module, and a mocked runner
cannot observe either one.

Each of those two runs a POSITIVE CONTROL first: the same command with the one
flag removed, in its own repository, which must exhibit the hazard. Without it
neither test can tell "the flag worked" from "the mechanism was never armed
here", and both were vacuous on at least one supported platform — the fsmonitor
script was written with `Path.write_text`, whose default newline translation
makes the shebang `#!/bin/sh\r` on Windows, where `chmod(S_IEXEC)` is a no-op
besides; and the index test is equally vulnerable on a filesystem whose mtime
granularity is coarser than git's racy window. A mechanism the control cannot
arm now skips with its reason rather than passing.

    """AC1's other half: the runtime builds a git subprocess at exactly one site.

    Before this feature that count was zero — a grep for git across
    `cargento_runtime/` returned nothing — so "exactly one" is a baseline this
    test establishes rather than an assumption it inherits. The likely second site
    is a `rev-parse` to answer "is this a repository?", and it must be folded into
    the one invocation instead: a non-repository is already distinguishable from
    the single command's exit status.

    Undecorated, for `GitProbeCallSiteTest`'s reason and measured the same way:
    every test here reads source text and spawns nothing, and with PATH pointed at
    an empty directory the `skipIf(GIT is None)` this class used to carry made the
    whole of AC1's second half disappear on exactly the host where a reviewer
    checking the boundary is most likely to be looking.

    Why a linter is not the oracle: `ruff check --select S6 .` is clean repo-wide
    and always was. `S607` (partial-executable-path) is syntactic, and argv[0] at
    the one call site is a variable — the resolved path — so the rule can never
    see it. That is the whole of what survives the cancelled DRC-4437.

    Two oracles, because neither subsumes the other. The shape walker reads the
    invocation and so sees `shell=`, an absolute path, `os.system`, a folded
    concatenation, an `os.environ.get` default and an f-string; the grep reads the
    text and so still sees a quoted `git` handed to something the walker cannot
    recognise as a spawner. Measured against ten evasion shapes introduced one at
    a time: the walker caught ten of ten, the grep three.
